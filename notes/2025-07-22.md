# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2025-07-22

## Q & A

attendees: 11


### One-line summaries
- üß≠ How can I stop Cornerstone3D from resampling oblique or tilted NIfTI volumes and preserve the original voxel structure?
- üìê How can I reliably convert OHIF measurement coordinates to image coordinates in Python when image orientation isn‚Äôt standard?
- üí¨ Should we switch from using a non-compliant ‚ÄúFinding Site‚Äù code for labels to using a standard DICOM comment text structure?
- üñ•Ô∏è Why isn‚Äôt the OHIF multimonitor feature launching on my extended display even after pop-up permissions and config changes?

üß≠ **I‚Äôm working with NIfTI volumes in Cornerstone3D. I explicitly set the orientation (e.g., AXIAL), and that part works as expected. However, when the volume includes gantry tilt or oblique acquisition, Cornerstone seems to reorient or resample the volume behind the scenes to make it appear ‚Äústraight‚Äù or axis-aligned. As a result, the original voxel spacing, slice positions, and tilt are lost, and I see interpolation artifacts. Is there a way to disable this behavior and display the volume exactly as it is stored ‚Äî without any automatic resampling or adjustment to make it orthogonal? I still want to control the viewing orientation (AXIAL/SAGITTAL/etc.), but I don‚Äôt want the data to be modified to ‚Äúfit‚Äù that view.**
- The new orientation handling in OHIF doesn't deliberately resample or reinterpret data but instead aligns the camera based on the volume‚Äôs orientation.
- A recent PR (merged June 16) introduced a `reformat` orientation mode for multi-planar reformats (MPR) which better preserves original acquisition geometry.
- This can be used to avoid the axial/sagittal/coronal snapping artifacts by setting the orientation to `reformat`, either manually or during viewer initialization.
- The user can toggle between orthogonal and acquisition-based orientations using the UI, similar to the reformat button in OHIF.

üìê **I am saving and loading measurements like the rectangle tool, length tool, and bidirectional tool as a DICOM SR. I want to extract the coordinate information for each measurement in Python ‚Äî my workflow is to extract this information using Pydicom. This process works very well for Images when loaded in OHIF as Stack viewports. Images when loading in OHIF as Volume viewports, where the Image Orientation Patient is [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. But I‚Äôve noticed that when the Image orientation is not [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], things go wrong‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve noticed that for volumetric viewports, the measurements are stored internally in OHIF in world coordinates...**
- All measurement coordinates are stored in **world coordinates** (LPS) in OHIF with Cornerstone 3D.
- The issue arises when trying to convert world coordinates to image (pixel) coordinates in Python; discrepancies occur when image orientation is not identity ([1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]).
- In these cases, `window.cornerstone.utilities.worldToImageCoords` may not be reliable, especially on non-stack/MPR viewports where reference image ID is unavailable.
- Use `viewport.getImageData().imageData.worldToIndex()` from the volume viewport in OHIF to convert properly.
- In Python, use **SimpleITK** (SITK) for robust conversion:
  - Use `TransformPhysicalPointToContinuousIndex()` for float index conversion
  - Use `TransformPhysicalPointToIndex()` for snapped (int) indices
- Coordinate systems differ between OHIF (LPS) and Slicer (RAS); convert LPS to RAS by negating X and Y axes if comparing between the two.

üí¨ **For storing label data, we currently use a ‚ÄúFinding Site‚Äù with a content code whose value is the label. That is completely non-DICOM compliant. What do people think about changing to use COMMENT_CODE = { schemeDesignator: "DCM", meaning: "Comment", value: "121106" } instead, as a qualitative evaluation appended to the end of the object?**
- The current method using `Finding Site` with `CORNERSTONEFREETEXT` is non-DICOM-compliant.
- Proposal to switch to using `Comment` (CodeValue: 121106, Designator: DCM) as a `TEXT` value inside a `Qualitative Evaluation`.
- This resolves the issue of misusing the code meaning field and aligns with DICOM standards.
- The team agreed with the proposal; it will be implemented without needing further discussion.
- Backward compatibility for reading will be preserved via fallback mechanisms.
- New approach allows up to 4GB text in `TextValue`, compared to the 64-character limitation in `CodeMeaning`.

üñ•Ô∏è **https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/5141, I know the issue was closed, and a related bug was fixed, but I still didn‚Äôt manage to open it (multimonitor). Even after changing the setup in config file, and allowing pop-up in browser.**
- The issue was partially fixed ‚Äî two of three multimonitor bugs were addressed.
- Joey's issue (nothing happening on extended monitor) seems specific to his setup.
- Suggestions provided:
  - Use `yarn dev` instead of Docker, as Docker may have limitations.
  - Confirm pop-ups are allowed in browser site settings.
  - Use config parameters such as `multiMonitor=split` and `screenNumber=0`
  - Try combinations with and without `launchAll=true`
- Some observed inconsistency in behavior depending on OS (macOS vs Windows).
- Team will investigate further; user is encouraged to continue testing and share reproducible steps.
