# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-10-03

## Q & A

Attendees: 15

🔍 **Q: Hi, wanted to follow up on this bug we've raised few months ago - we've tried the workaround you've suggested few weeks ago during office hours(to add false param in segmentationService.getSegmentations() func call in PanelSegmentation.tsx), but it still doesn't work with segmentation files we've tried.**

A:
- The fix for this issue is coming with the Cornerstone 3D 2.0 migration
- Expected release: end of next week in the master branch
- Will be included in OHIF 3.9 release after QA
- The fix was demonstrated to work with the provided sample data

💾 **Q: We're implementing a feature in the viewer to review AI generated segments and allow users to accept or reject them. When storing the new dicom seg file, we save the rejected segment's original pixel data in an array buffer under the private tag(in case we ever need to restore it). For a larger segment file of 75 segments, rejecting all segments and storing all their pixel data crashes in dcmjs write function with RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed. We've got it fixed by compressing the pixel data array buffer using js Compression Streams API before storing. But wondering if you know any other solutions for such a problem?**

A:
- Use web workers to run heavy tasks in the background
  - Cornerstone.js provides a solid web worker framework
  - Example: `cornerstone.js.org/docs/concepts/core/webWorkers`
- Consider using RLE (Run-Length Encoding) for segmentation data
  - More efficient for repetitive data like segmentations
  - OHIF is moving towards RLE encoding for segmentation frameworks
  - Expected 220x improvement for segmentation brushing

🖌️ **Q: We're trying to create a custom Cornerstone tool by extending the AnnotationTool, but we're having trouble drawing a dashed line while dragging the mouse—it doesn't show up in the viewport. But the solid line showed up after we finished drawing the lines. Do you have any suggestions for fixing this issue or references that might help? I can share my screen to show the bug**

A:
- Demonstrated how to add line dash style in the tool's render function
- Suggested developing tools directly in Cornerstone for faster iteration
- Provided example code for implementing dashed lines
- Recommended focusing on Cornerstone development before integrating with OHIF

🖥️ **Q: How can I serve OHIF using Express.js? Basically the use case is, We are making an Electron app to predownload studies on the user's device and then serve those files using Express.js to the OHIF viewer. Because of doing that it improved the study load time by a lot. Now the problem is we are showing the OHIF viewer on an Iframe which is hosted on our cloud, we would like to improve the loading time even more by serving the viewer using the same Express.js server. I was able to serve it using express.static but I get the following error when browsing that route. Is it even a good idea to serve OHIF using the Express.js?**

A:
- OHIF can be served from any server, including Express.js
- The issue seems to be related to MIME types and file paths
- Suggestions:
  - Configure Express to serve correct MIME types for CSS and other assets
  - Ensure correct file paths when serving static files
  - Look into Express.static configuration for serving from subdirectories

📊 **Q: How can I fetch data on OHIF using graphql? The use case for this is, our dicom files are stored in Orthanc and study data is synced in Hasura. We have both a mobile app and a webapp and also a desktop app(electron) which is basically the webapp. Our mobile app is querying the data from Hasura and OHIF is getting the data from Orthanc which is causing some inconsistencies so we would like to sync them both.**

A:
- The issue seems to be a database synchronization problem between Orthanc and Hasura
- Suggested approach:
  1. Create a custom data source in OHIF
  2. Implement a "reverse proxy" in the custom data source to route requests
  3. Route some requests to GraphQL and others to DICOM web as needed
  4. Create a custom extension to implement this without modifying core OHIF code

🧩 **Q: How can I create custom extensions for OHIF. And what are the use cases for creating custom extensions?**

A:
- Use cases for custom extensions:
  - Custom panels
  - Special commands
  - Custom toolbar layouts
  - Integration of AI models (e.g., Segment Anything)
- Steps to create a custom extension:
  1. Define the extension module (e.g., panel, command, toolbar)
  2. Implement the required components and logic
  3. Register the extension in the mode configuration
- Resources:
  - OHIF documentation: platform extensions and modules
  - Presentation on OHIF V2 Architecture (91 slides)

📏 **Q: Could you please clarify the motivation for the Measurement Tracking workflow in OHIF? It's unclear to me why a user may want measurements to be untracked. My users are also confused by measurements being tracked vs. untracked, and why this limitation exists.**

A:
- Original concept was for DICOM Structured Reports (SRs)
- Allows tracking measurements loaded from SRs to save new copies and export
- Enables grouping measurements into reports or keeping them separate
- The team acknowledges that the current implementation may need revisiting
- Open to community feedback for potential improvements

🎨 **Q: I am new to OHIF. Following the documentation I can create a custom mode > extension > panel. I am trying to add buttons, inputs, and text to this panel. Is there a proper way to do this?**

A:
- Use React for building custom panels and components
- Leverage OHIF's UI component library:
  - Import from '@ohif/ui' or '@ohif/ui-next'
  - Provides styled and consistent components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- Resources:
  - OHIF UI component playground (coming soon at ui.ohif.org)
  - Example code in the OHIF repository
- Tips:
  - Use '@ohif/ui-next' for newer components when available
  - Fall back to '@ohif/ui' for components not yet in ui-next
