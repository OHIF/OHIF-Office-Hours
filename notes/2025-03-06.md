🎬 **Made some changes to the video segmentation PR**
- Code changes followed previous week's discussion:
  - Added frame numbers to derived image data.
  - Set image data through an image change event listener format.
- The PR aligns with previous recommendations and will be reviewed soon.

📱 **Rendering issues in some Android—is it resolved?**
- The rendering issue is temporarily resolved by a hack, but the correct solution is pending on the VTK.js side.
- Temporary solution:
  - On the Cornerstone side, detection ensures it doesn’t force 16-bit linear rendering unnecessarily.
- Users facing the issue should engage in the existing VTK.js issue discussion to push for a permanent solution:

🐳 **We are using the Orthanc plugin Docker image version 1.12.6 to integrate OHIF. We encountered an issue where, if the Patient ID is set to "NA" for certain studies, navigating to the URL...**
- Recommended solutions:
  - Apply logic either within the study browser (`PanelStudyBrowser`) or in the data source (`DicomWebDataSource`) to handle queries.
  - Add logic specifically in the `queryStudies` function to handle cases where the Patient ID is "NA", returning an empty result instead of querying.
  - Clarified the URL provided (`/ohif/viewer/studyInstanceUID`) only calls OHIF; the logic for MRN filtering must be implemented in the query or Orthanc data source code.

🖥️ **Would like to readd the errors to console since the error modals sometimes do not work, how could I go about it?**
- Errors currently appear as console logs, not always as errors.
- Suggested:
  - Submit an issue if errors are not correctly appearing.
  - A logging framework is under development, which will provide configurable log levels, improving error logging and visibility, but this is still forthcoming.

🎨 **I've been creating my own mode and want to add segmentation functionality. I thought I would be able to follow the setup of the 'Basic Viewer' mode but I can't find where this is defined under the Viewers folder.**
- Clarified the difference between "Basic Viewer" and "Longitudinal" modes; the naming was an oversight.
- Segmentation functionality involves multiple steps:
  - Include segmentation panel with tools from cornerstone extensions (panel segmentation with tools).
  - Define segmentation tools (brush tool, etc.) via UI and tool groups (`initToolGroups`).
  - Add tools into the active/passive groups (brush, shapes).
- Provided code snippet for integrating tools:
  ```javascript
  // Adding tools to segmentation toolbox
  import brushTools from 'path/to/segmentationButtons';
  createButtonSection(brushTools, 'segmentation-toolbox');
  
  // Activating tools in initToolGroups
  {
    active: [{ toolName: 'Brush', bindings: [{ mouseButton: MouseBindings.Primary }] }],
    passive: ['RectangleROI', 'EllipticalROI', ...other tools],
  }
  ```
- Recognized and planned to fix naming confusion in the next updates.

🖼️ **How, if able, can we add the required codecs, for example, to use JLS image on the viewer?**
- Explained codecs (e.g., JLS) are dynamically loaded automatically by Cornerstone3D when required.
- No manual config is necessary; codecs are loaded via WebAssembly (WASM) automatically upon encountering compatible images.
- If images aren't rendering, investigate other potential issues and report specific reproducible cases for further debugging.

---

🎨 **Is there any news for the linear fusion blend mode? We were waiting for a VTK PR to be merged.**
- No updates yet; still waiting for VTK.js to merge the relevant multi-volume linear fusion PR.
- Once merged, integration will be revisited immediately.

---

📦 **What’s the limitation of 3D Rendering Segmentation?**
- Main limitation: inefficiency of current DICOM SEG format, causing large file sizes and slow loading/rendering.
  - DICOM SEG currently stores each segment independently per slice, leading to redundant data and massive file sizes.
- Solutions mentioned:
  - Upcoming DICOM Label Map (Supplement 243) will significantly optimize storage (one map per slice rather than per segment), greatly reducing file size and loading time (~20x improvement).
  - Client-side conversion from Labelmap to Surface is computationally heavy; currently uses a single web worker.
- Recommended improvements:
  - Increase number of web workers (`maxWorkerInstance`) to utilize multi-threading capabilities.
  - Possibly implement on-demand segment conversion or pre-calculate/store mesh polygons externally (though storage size would increase substantially).

🛠️ **What is the `preload` in canvas actor and how does it affect segmentation opacity?**
- Explained `preload` is a special hack for specific cases (e.g., maximum intensity projection viewport handling).
- Not relevant for the current opacity issue described.
- The actual issue: opacity in `canvasActor` not connected to the style system (`setScalarOpacity`).
- Advised debugging within the style-rendering path rather than `preload`, specifically checking `getColor` and `setScalarOpacity`.

---

🎨 **Is there any update for the linear fusion blend mode?**
- Awaiting a specific VTK.js PR merge to proceed.
- Already subscribed to PR updates and will handle integration post-merge immediately.
