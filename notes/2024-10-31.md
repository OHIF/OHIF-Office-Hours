# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-10-31

## Q & A

Attendees: 11

Discussed:


- üì± Responsive UI/UX updates are in progress, focusing on mobile/tablet layouts in the next release.
- üß≠ MPR alignment for tilted datasets requires enhancements to the hanging protocol to support computed orientations.
- üóìÔ∏è OHIF Viewer will be updated with Cornerstone 2.0 in the upcoming 3.9 release.
- üñãÔ∏è SAM integration in OHIF is planned for November, alongside new segmentation tools in Cornerstone.
- ‚û°Ô∏è WebGL context errors with React Router and Cornerstone can be resolved by clearing the cache on route changes, or by upgrading to Cornerstone 2.0.
- ‚ö™ Whitish rendering in MPR should be tested on the `fit/cs3d2` branch, ensuring the latest Cornerstone 2.0 changes are used.
- üìå The arrow rendering issue with two points in Cornerstone 3D has been fixed.


üì± **What is the current status regarding New UI/UX (Responsive)? I could see that the roadmap was updated until the end of this year. Does this new feature bring new design to tablet or mobile devices, e.g. smaller panel, disable some tools.. Etc, Or everything will be there, but in small size? What is the current main limitation? I can load OHIF at mobile but everything is there.**
- The new responsive UI/UX is gradually being implemented. Version 3.9 includes responsive updates to core components and some panels.
- The next version will focus on prototyping the layout for tablet and mobile devices, aiming for a different layout based on the device.
- Feedback from users and sponsors is welcome during the prototyping phase.
- The ideal scenario is a single URL with adaptable layout for different devices. Progressive web apps are being considered as a middle ground before native apps.
- Cornerstone 3D 2.0 improvements will aid mobile devices, but limitations exist regarding the size of loadable volumes, especially for 4D images.

üß≠ **CT stroke data received as little tilted, so original Axial scan, head is not straight. When we render this data into the viewer, Stack renders correctly as it makes alignment correct. But the MPR view is rendered as it is. Is that little alignment can we apply on MPR so images look correct? Also if you can show in stack rendering where and how we make changes in alignment.**
- Stack rendering correctly aligns tilted data, but MPR doesn't.  A feature request is recommended to address MPR alignment.
- The issue arises from MPR using the axial size of the coronal, while the acquisition might be oblique or tilted.
- The solution involves identifying the correct camera angle and viewport orientation using the image metadata (direction and scan axis cosines).
- The hanging protocol should support computed values for orientation, allowing dynamic calculation of viewport normal and view right.
- Cornerstone supports orientation vectors, but OHIF's hanging protocol needs to be extended.
- Short-term solutions: use "axial like" or snap to the closest 90-degree angle.

üóìÔ∏è **Recently, cornerstone was updated to 2.0.Will OHIF viewer be updated accordingly soon (this year)?**
- Yes, OHIF Viewer will be updated to Cornerstone 2.0 in the next week's 3.9 release.
- https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pulls

üñãÔ∏è **I recently integrated SAM2 in OHIF. I saw you have a plan to release SAM in OHIF this month. Is there anything I should be aware of it before I l release the code?**
- The open-sourcing of SAM in OHIF is planned for November. This involves a piece within Cornerstone and design/integration work within OHIF.
- Several new segmentation tools will be merged into Cornerstone in November, including interpolation for label maps, API for segmentation metrics, undo/redo functionality, a new 3D brush tool, web GPU-based gradient tools, whole body contouring, segment propagation/auto-adjustment, and MIP rendering of segmentation outlines.
- These new tools are local and do not require a server.
- OHIF is also developing a segment editing model (version 1).  Collaboration on integrating the user's segment editing model (version 2) is welcomed after the OHIF version is released.

‚û°Ô∏è **Is there some best practices for using Cornerstone 3d volume loader with React router (sorry if it exists could not find it) - when trying to navigate right now i get an error related to open GL
Error: WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: bindTexture: object does not belong to this context**
- This issue should be resolved in Cornerstone 2.0. Upgrading is recommended.
- The error likely arises from not properly clearing the Cornerstone cache when switching routes.
- Solutions:
    - Call `cache.purge()` when the Cornerstone viewer service is destroyed.
    - Use lifecycle hooks like `onModeExit` to clear ongoing requests, disable the scene, and purge the cache.
    - Implement a similar `onModeExit` function within your custom service.

‚ö™ **I am still waiting for anonymized data so I can share here, but as mention in this issue, https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4450MPR is render something whitish, what could be a problem, stack render it correctly**
- Try using the `fit/cs3d2` branch to see if the whitish rendering issue persists.
- Ensure you are using the latest Cornerstone 2.0 changes. Building issues due to Node version conflicts can be addressed via `git bisect` and patching.
- Cornerstone 2.0 examples should work. Deploy previews on Netlify are working, indicating a potential issue with the local example page setup.
- Several bugs have been reported with Cornerstone in custom environments, often related to structured cloning in Vue/VueX and incompatibility with certain decoders and optimization settings in Vite.
- Recipes for React, Vue, Angular, and Next.js are available for Cornerstone 2.0.  Pay attention to VASM and asset inclusion in the compiler configuration.

üìå **[No question text provided, related to arrow rendering in Cornerstone 3D]**
- The issue of arrow rendering with two points has been addressed and implemented. The provided link likely refers to the relevant discussion or pull request.
