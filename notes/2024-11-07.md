# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-11-07

## Q & A

Attendees: 14

Discussed:
- 🔬 Microscopy mode uses Cornerstone for integration but still relies on Dicom Microscopy Viewer as a renderer; segmentation support is complex.
- ➕ Crosshairs in 3D view are not supported; use "jump to click" for MIP.
- ⬇️ DICOM decompression issues might be due to DCM4CHEE configuration or server settings, not OHIF's default behavior.
- ✏️ Use the `SEGMENTATION_DATA_MODIFIED` event to handle segmentation editing actions.
- 🚀 Improve DICOM load times by switching from `mkdicomweb` to a production-ready solution like CloudFront and S3.
- 🖱️ Handle mouse button combinations with custom `mousedown` event listeners.
- 🔑 Contact the OHIF community on Slack for guidance on OIDC with Microsoft Identity Platform and contribute a documentation PR.




🔬 **Is microscopy mode integrated into basic mode? Does microscopy viewer still rely on dicom-microscopy-viewer? Or will it be replaced by cornerstone? Therefore segmentation will be supported next year?**
- Microscopy mode is integrated into Cornerstone, but Dicom Microscopy Viewer is still used as a renderer. This allows for better layout flexibility and Cornerstone tool compatibility.
- While contour segmentation is theoretically possible and straightforward, label map segmentation is complex due to tile-based rendering.  Support for whole slide image contouring isn't on the immediate roadmap.
- Contours in Cornerstone 3D are 2D elements and can be converted to 3D using tools like the contour-to-surface function in Polymorph segmentation.
- The legacy microscopy mode is maintained for compatibility with existing saved data and features not yet fully supported in the new mode, such as fluorescence and certain navigation aspects.

➕ **Just a small question, will the crosshairs tool in cornerstone3d work on 3d view, i.e can we synchronize it on all the 4 views(mpr and 3d)?**
- Crosshairs are not practical in 3D view due to the use of transfer functions that make it difficult to map clicks to specific data points.
- The "jump to click" tool is suitable for MIP views where data points are directly represented, but not for 3D volume rendering.

⬇️ **It seems that the way that OHIF is requesting images by default is causing DCM4CHEE to decompress them on the server-side. This has two problems: one, it requires that images are fully downloaded onto the server in order to decompress them, and then send them to the client, so it becomes a blocking process. Secondly, of course because we're sending more data, it requires more bandwidth. According to the OHIF docs, the default should be to fetch compressed images, by setting application/octet-stream as the accept header. But DCM4CHEE is implemented the other way around: in order to return compressed images, we should use anything else other than the application/octet-stream accept header. Is that intentional for some reason? Or could it be a bug on DCM4CHEE?**
- Setting `requestTransferSyntaxUID = '*'` should instruct the server to return the native transfer syntax without transcoding.
- The issue may lie in DCM4CHEE's configuration or the server's preferred transfer syntax (e.g., LEI). Inspecting network requests and verifying the `Accept` header is crucial.
- Specifying the compressed transfer syntax explicitly or using `Accept: */*` (which should accept any encapsulation) are alternatives, but DCM4CHEE might have limitations with certain image types and this header.

✏️ **Which function is responsible for handling editing actions in segmentation tools (Brush, Eraser etc.) when painting/erasing segments?**
- Subscribe to the `SEGMENTATION_DATA_MODIFIED` event.  This event provides the `segmentationId` and optionally an array of `modifiedSlicesToUse`.

```typescript
/**
* EventDetail for when a Segmentation Data is modified by a tool
*/
type SegmentationDataModifiedEventDetail = {
 /** unique id of the segmentationData */
 segmentationId: string;
 /** array of slice indices in a labelmap which have been modified */
 // TODO: This is labelmap-specific and needs to be a labelmap-specific event
 modifiedSlicesToUse?: number[];
};
```

🚀 **I have been using OHIF viewer for a project for about 6 months or so. I want to improve the load-times of the DICOM images. Are there any resources available to optimize this?
For more information, we are using mkdicomweb right now, because we tested and the dataset loads really slow in comparison using an Orthanc server. My guess is it has to do with the streaming/compression mkdicomweb is doing. Any resources?**
- `dicomwebserver` is not intended for production use; it's a single-threaded Express.js server.
- Consider using CloudFront and AWS S3 for optimized delivery via CDN. Examples for deployment are available in `static-dicom-web`.

🖱️ **Can I listen to mouse button combination events (just click, not dragging) like cornerstone3d mouse bindings in OHIF?
Primary_And_Secondary
Primary_And_Auxiliary
Primary_And_Secondary_And_Auxiliary
Fourth_Button
Fifth_Button**
- OHIF does not have built-in handling for specific mouse button combinations.
- Implement a custom solution by listening to the standard `mousedown` event on the DOM and checking the `MouseEvent` object's properties (`buttons`, `altKey`, `shiftKey`, etc.) to detect the desired combinations.

🔑 **Do you have a guideline or example to set up OIDC in OHIF with Microsoft Identity Platform?**
- While no official guideline exists, someone in the OHIF community has accomplished this.  Connect on Slack to inquire further and contribute a PR to the OHIF documentation after resolving the issue.

⚙️ **any examples of how to use the dynamic dicomweb data source feature in “onConfiguration”?**
- `onConfiguration` allows intercepting and modifying data source settings dynamically, for example, using URL parameters.
- The DICOM web proxy is an alternative for simpler cases where only the domain name changes.
- Keyops dynamic URL handling (using the `dicomWebProxy` and the `url` parameter in the viewer) provides another approach.  See `kheops.js` for an example:
    - https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/blob/master/platform/app/public/config/kheops.js

- Example of `onConfiguration` with GCP Healthcare API:

```javascript
{
    namespace: '@ohif/extension-default.dataSourcesModule.dicomweb',
    sourceName: 'gcpdicomweb',
    configuration: {
        // ... other config
        onConfiguration: (dicomWebConfig, options) => {
            const { params } = options;
            // ... extract parameters from options.params
            const pathUrl = `...`; // Build dynamic URL
            return {
                ...dicomWebConfig, // Merge with existing config
                wadoRoot: pathUrl,
                // ... other dynamic settings
            };
          },
    },
}
```
