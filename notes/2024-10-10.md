## Q & A

Attendees: 12

Discussed:


üîÑ Implementing viewport overlay toggling with better state management using Zustand
üîí Customizing measurement colors based on labels and active state using annotation config
üñºÔ∏è Integrating surface segmentations with MIP views in Cornerstone (upcoming feature)
üìä Troubleshooting volume loading issues with DICOM P10 format in coronal and sagittal views
üîç Understanding slab thickness and MIP rendering in volume viewports using Cornerstone API
üíæ Developing a new approach for loading DICOM images from ByteArrays with custom image loaders



üîÑ **Q: I had a question about toggling the Viewport Overlays (the demographics text, not the DICOM image overlays). I've added a new menu item to toggle them and I've added a new state to the CornerstoneOverlay**

A:
- The issue is related to state management and triggering re-renders
- Recommended solution: Use Zustand for global state management
  - Create a new store for viewport text overlay
  - Use the store in both the command and the component
  - This will make the component reactive to state changes
- Example implementation:
  - Create a store with mode (none, minimal, full) and setter function
  - Use the store in the command to update the state
  - In the component, use the store to get the current state and trigger re-renders

üîí **Q: How can i change measurement colors, what i wanna have is different color for different measurement depends on measurement.label where measurement.isActive == true**

A:
- Use the annotation configuration API to set colors
  - Can set colors for different states: active, highlighted, locked, etc.
- OHIF is adding a new "data row" component with color pickers
- There's an existing feature to link colors to finding codes:
  - Look in the basic test mode configuration
  - Check the menu customization example
  - See the `getCustomizationModule` function for coding values
- Refer to the documentation for the customization service
- Reference: https://www.cornerstonejs.org/docs/concepts/cornerstone-tools/annotation/config

üñºÔ∏è **Q: Is it possible to mix surface segmentations and MIP views? I'd like to show a MIP view of a PET volume and 3D (surface) segmentations. Latter should always appear on top of the former.**

A:
- Full integration of surface segmentations and MIP is coming soon (around November)
- Current limitations:
  - Blending surfaces with MIP has rendering issues
  - Correct depth ordering is difficult to achieve
- Upcoming feature:
  - Will show outlines of segmentations on MIP
  - Similar to commercial software like MIM
  - Outlines will recalculate and rotate with the MIP view
- For now, using surface rendering with MIP has limitations in depth perception and blending

üìä **Q: Whenever loading the Volume loading using DICOM p10 format, coronal and sagittal mode are broken, I tried changing the height of the viewport, but it did not work. When i use the DICOM web format, those other views works properly**

A:
- The issue is likely related to slice ordering
- Debugging steps:
  1. Check the metadata for proper sorting information
  2. Look into the `sortImageIdsAndGetSpacing` function in the Cornerstone streaming image volume loader
  3. Verify that the first image (index 0) is not causing issues (e.g., localizer image)
- Suggested fix: Adjust the sorting logic or handle cases where the first image might be problematic
- Reference: packages/streaming-image-volume-loader/src/cornerstoneStreamingImageVolumeLoader.ts

üîç **Q: I am trying the example of Volume VIewport API- https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/volumeapi, in that, I am trying out the Slab thickness, questions on same - 1. Is it like creating MIP? 2. Any formula to define the maximum slab thickness**

A:
- Slab thickness is related to volume rendering and sampling
- Thin slab: Default rendering, samples a thin slice of the volume
- Thick slab: Samples a larger portion of the volume
- MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection) is one type of thick slab rendering
- Slab thickness options:
  - Specific thickness (e.g., 1mm, 2mm)
  - Full volume (uses a calculation based on volume dimensions)
- Maximum slab thickness:
  - For practical purposes, use a very large number (e.g., 1000)
  - The rendering pipeline will automatically handle boundaries
- Different slab rendering modes:
  - Average (Gaussian-like)
  - Maximum (MIP)
  - Minimum

üíæ **Q: DICOM image loading from a ByteArray**

A:
- The previous method of overriding the loader parameter has been removed
- Reasons for removal:
  - Issues with transferring functions to Web Workers
  - Potential for introducing bugs due to inconsistent options
- Recommended approach:
  1. Create a custom image loader
  2. Internally use WADO-URI loader for DICOM parsing
  3. Implement your own caching mechanism if needed
- Future improvements:
  - Create a base implementation for DICOM parsing
  - Develop a separate DICOM Cornerstone library
  - Make metadata providers more modular and reusable
- The community is encouraged to contribute to this effort
