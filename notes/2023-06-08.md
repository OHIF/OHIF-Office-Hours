### CORS issues for MPR and MIP which use SAB, and why Image loading from different origin works but not MPR SAB

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer

cross origin isolation just means that the client page has some policies defined for cross origin requests

One is opener policy:

COOP will process-isolate your document and potential attackers canâ€™t access your global object if they were to open it in a popup, preventing a set of cross-origin attacks dubbed XS-Leaks.
so If a cross-origin document with COOP is opened in a new window, the opening document will not have a reference to it, and the window.opener property of the new window will be null

The other policy is Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy which we are setting it in the header as require-corp. This means that A document can only load resources from the same origin, or resources explicitly marked as loadable from another origin.

If a cross origin resource supports CORS, the crossorigin attribute or the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header must be used to load it without being blocked by COEP.

The important part is resources explicitly marked as loadable from another origin
