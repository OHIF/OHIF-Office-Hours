## OHIF Viewer Office Hours - Questions and Answers


**üîé  ** **Given a binary mask I have generated, how can I leverage the SegmentationService class in OHIF to display a new segmentation in the SEG viewer? I have been looking at the getSOPClassHandlerModule file as well.** 

*   You can look at the solution implemented for the Monai project (a framework by NVIDIA).
*   It's essentially about leveraging the `SegmentationService` to hydrate the segmentation directly instead of storing it as a DICOM SEG object.
*   The `UpdateView` component in OHIF parses the data sent by your backend, which could be in various formats like RRD or JSON.
*   On the frontend, you create a `Segmentation` object and update its `scalarData` with the data received from the backend. 
*   Refer to the Monai Label project (specifically the OAF v3 plugin) and the OHIF source code for examples.
*   There is a plan to simplify this process in a future version of OHIF, but for now, the existing codebase with the `SegmentationService` is a good starting point.
*   Instead of using RRD for data transfer, you could consider using JSON with RLE encoding for better compression and speed.

**üñ•Ô∏è ** **How can we view DICOM SR? Its an SR from an ultrasound**

*   OHIF has good support for DICOM SR, but the specific display depends on the SR type (e.g., graphical or textual).
*   ViewerDev (viewerdev.ohif.org) has a well-curated set of DICOM data, including different SR types. You can find examples there.
*   There are different types of SRs:
    *   Graphical SRs that can be viewed with annotations and editing capabilities.
    *   Textual SRs that display textual reports.
    *   Other types that may contain special measurements and data, which are not always easily viewable as text.
*   There's a PR in progress for support for 3D coordinate SRs.
*   DICOM SR has various types, and OHIF supports the most commonly used ones.
*   If you have an SR you need to view, try dragging and dropping it into the `/local-basic` folder of OHIF ViewerDev. 
*   If OHIF doesn't support a particular SR type, you can create a feature request and provide data for analysis.

**‚è±Ô∏è** **I see the viewer used a combination of QIDO + WADO loading to improve the loading speed. Do you know why this solution was removed later on?**

*   QIDO was initially used to quickly find available information within a study, potentially returning a limited set of metadata.
*   However, as more features (3D, segmentations, SRs) were added, using solely QIDO for data retrieval led to inconsistent and potentially incorrect display of data.
*   In some cases, relying on partial metadata from QIDO could lead to patient safety concerns due to incorrect image interpretation.
*   WADO is the preferred method for retrieving the full DICOM object data, ensuring accurate display and interpretation.

<br>

**üîÑ** **What is the use case for QIDO and WADO?**

*   KIDO is intended for finding information about what's available within a study.
*   It's ideal for initial study browsing to identify series of interest based on limited metadata. 
*   WADO is intended to access the full DICOM object data.
*   It provides complete access to the DICOM information needed for viewing and analysis.

<br>

**‚öôÔ∏è** **How can we force the user to use a predefined label for the measurements?**

*   OHIF recently added the ability to force the user to select from a predefined set of labels for measurements.
*   You can achieve this by adding mode customizations (e.g., `customizationService.addModeCustomizations`) and defining the allowed labels.
*   Check the documentation in the OHIF newsletter for a detailed explanation and code example.


<br>

**üñºÔ∏è** **How can we improve the loading speed for studies, especially for very large datasets?**
* The initial load of large datasets (like the "Jurassic" dataset with 40,000 instances) can be slow.
* Factors contributing to slow loading can include:
    * The large amount of metadata being transferred.
    * The Namify process applied to every attribute in every instance.
    * DICOM web server configuration affecting metadata transfer.
* Considerations for optimization:
    *  Use server-side caching (e.g., with DCM4CHEE's series-level summary cache) to reduce the amount of repeated data transfers. This can be configured via JMX settings in DCM4CHEE, such as the "series summary cache".
    * Explore using DCMJS-commands module and caching tools to download metadata to a local file system (like Azure or S3) to reduce network traffic.
    *  Consider using a deduplicated data format to minimize redundancy in data storage.
    *  Explore on-demand Namify implementation in DCMJS for better performance.
* An ongoing project within OHIF involves improving DCMJS to implement on-demand Namify. This could significantly impact performance for very large datasets.

**4Ô∏è‚É£**  **My 4D Ultrasound data is read in older OHIF versions but has black patches in newer ones. What can I do?**
*   OHIF 3.9 is a beta branch and may contain inconsistencies.
*   OHIF determines whether data is 4D by checking for dynamic volume tags in the DICOM metadata.
*   If your ultrasound data doesn't have the supported tags, OHIF might not recognize it as 4D. 
*   You can find out why it isn't recognized as 4D by reviewing the `getDynamicVolumeInfo` function in the default OHIF extension.
*   Review the Cornerstone library for how dynamic volume/4D data is processed.
*   Inspect the DICOM data to see if the tags are present. If not, consider creating a pull request to OHIF to add support for the specific tags your data uses.
*   If you can share the data, it can be analyzed further to improve 4D ultrasound support in OHIF.

<br>

**üìÅ** **Is there a way to create a local cache with OHIF to improve loading speeds?**
* You can use DCMJS-commands for this purpose.
*  It allows downloading metadata from a DICOM web server to a local filesystem. 
*  This can be combined with a serverless function in cloud platforms like Azure to automatically cache metadata from the DICOM web server and make it available for OHIF.
*   This approach keeps the cache updated using image availability notifications (IAN).

<br>


**üì°** **What are the future plans for DCMJS-commands?**

*   A pull request for web-based downloads is in progress. 
*   The goal is to support downloads for the required metadata for OHIF.
*   Further development plans include:
    *  Improving dump commands.
    *  Adding DICOMweb and DIMSE services for local web service with storage.
    *  Supporting push functionality to DIMSE endpoints and possibly DICOMweb endpoints.
