## Q & A

### Docker file issue for OHIF-v3

RUN APP_CONFIG=config/default.js yarn run build

Another thing to note is that the config file should be under the public folder in the platform/viewer

### How to get 3d segmentation information for a segment index.

A: segmentationModule getLabelMap3D in legacy code

### What is the difference between StackViewport and VolumeViewport in general and related to Segmentation? Is MRI a Stack or a Volume?

A: segmentation works on VolumeViewport. There might be StackViewport support in the future.
StackViewport images can be any size and any orientation within a stack.

StackViewport is the default. StackViewport can be converted to a VolumeViewport (client-side) (can go back-and-forth between them). Look at \_hydrateSEG.ts for conversion.

Look at TMTV hp module for example to create/hang a volume viewport.
