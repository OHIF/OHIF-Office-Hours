## ‚úÖ Questions and summarized answers


üß© **Questions regarding custom annotation manager: How to restrict annotation display to a specific series - by default, annotations sharing a Frame of reference will display across series, but only in volume viewport. Correct way to derive a groupKey based on the element - have to put data (i.e. series UID) on the element**
- Annotations are grouped by default using the frame of reference UID. However, this can be overridden using a custom selector.
- The `addAnnotation` API accepts a selector which can be a string (frame of reference UID) or a div element, especially useful for stack viewports.
- Internally, the default `getGroupKey` function extracts the frame of reference UID from the element.
- Plans are underway to improve the `getViewReference` function, allowing it to accept parameters to narrow annotation scope by SOP instance UID or series UID‚Äîthus enabling annotations to appear only in specific images or series.
- Display logic will move towards using `viewReference` and `isReferenceViewable`, making `groupKey` less critical in the future.
- `groupKey` remains useful for separating types of annotations (e.g., contours vs. measurements, or different annotators), especially when toggling visibility.
- The current annotation state manager should act more as a storage system, and filtering logic should happen via `isReferenceViewable` and `getViewReference`.
- No major need for `groupKey` unless differentiating annotation types or user-specific annotations.

üêõ **We found that OHIF was freezing when we tried to load our DICOM SEG**
- The freeze occurs because the current segmentation loading process reads all image data and headers synchronously, especially in local file mode.
- This is inefficient and can cause UI lockups when dealing with large SEG datasets.
- Suggested fix: transition segmentation loading to a more efficient DICOMweb-based streaming approach.
- The issue does not appear when using DICOMweb, pointing to inefficiencies in local file parsing.

üß† **I tried the new segmentation tools in 3.10 with Linux and it seems to fail (guided, one click, and ONNX seg). The interpolation and bidirectional tools were working as well as the paint, eraser and threshold tools. Also tried with FF nightly to see if WebGPU support will help. Still faced some errors. The machine I tried has only onboard graphics. Is there any way we can identify browser support and hide/disable the unsupported tools?**
- On Linux, WebGPU support might be under a flag and is not enabled by default.
- Suggested tools to verify WebGPU compatibility:
  - [Chrome WebGPU troubleshooting](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/webgpu/troubleshooting-tips)
  - [WebGPU Playground](https://06wj.github.io/WebGPU-Playground/#/Samples/HelloCanvas)
- Use these tools to confirm if WebGPU rendering works and then conditionally disable unsupported tools.

üí• **Is there any way you could help to decipher the error with the compiling shader I‚Äôm getting when loading a study with OHIF version 3.9.1?**
- This error often originates from the VTK.js library used for rendering.
- Common causes include zero spacing in the Z-axis or corrupted/unsupported data.
- Suggested fixes:
  - Upgrade to OHIF v3.10 which includes an updated version of VTK.
  - If using OHIF 3.9.x, try upgrading to 3.9.3 where many rendering bugs were fixed.
  - If the problem persists, share the dataset via GitHub for further debugging.

üß™ **For automated testing, e.g., Playwright, do you have any conditions you typically use to check pass/fail for initial image/thumbnail loading?**
- OHIF uses Playwright with screenshot comparisons:
  - App-level tests allow up to 4% pixel mismatch (previously 10%).
  - Library-level tests (like Cornerstone‚Äôs TG18) allow **zero tolerance**.
- Pixel data for thumbnails and viewports can be extracted from canvas:
  
  ```js
  const cc = cornerstone.getRenderingEngines()[0]._viewports.get('default').canvas;
  const ctx = cc.getContext("2d");
  const vp = cornerstone.getRenderingEngines()[0]._viewports.get('default');
  const imageData = ctx.getImageData(vp.sx, vp.sy, vp.sWidth, vp.sHeight);
```
