## Q & A

Attendees: 7

- 📂 What are the options for downloading DICOM SEG and DICOM SR in OHIF?
- 🔄 Can the scroll sync feature from the Basic Viewer mode be included in other modes?
- 📏 Is it possible to visualize measurements across multiple views (e.g., axial, sagittal, coronal) in MPR?
- 🌀 Are there any updates or new developments related to linear fusion?
- 🔧 How can the annotation tool be configured to auto-toggle back to the scroll tool after use?

📂 **Options for downloading DICOM SEG and DICOM SR?**
- DICOM SEG download is currently supported. Steps:
  - Add segmentation.
  - Right-click on the segmentation and select "Export and Download."
  - The download functionality is confirmed to work in viewer.ohif.org.
- DICOM SR:
  - There is a "Create SR" functionality that pushes data back to PACS.
  - A "Download SR" feature is not currently available but can be implemented.
  - Suggested implementation:
    - Modify the `Create SR` function in the `dicomweb-datasource/store` file.
    - Instead of storing the instance, assign it to a URL and enable download.
    - Use the `dataset part` and `buffer` to create a URL object for the file.
- Links provided:
  - [OHIF v2-legacy repository](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/tree/v2-legacy)
  - [Code example for downloading files](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/blob/v2-legacy/extensions/debugging/src/downloadAndZip.js)

🔄 **Are there plans to include THIS scroll sync feature that is available in the Basic Viewer mode also in other modes?**
- The OHIF Viewer is a framework, not a fixed product.
- If a feature from one mode is needed in another, it can be added through customization.
- Example provided: Adding "Stack Scroll" functionality to the "Segmentation" mode.
  - Go to `modes/segmentation/toolbarButtons`.
  - Add the "Stack Scroll" button to the "More Tools" section of the desired mode.
  - Toolbar buttons can be modified to include features from any mode.
- Customization of the OHIF framework requires understanding where to make changes.

📏 **In MPR, is it possible to visualize measurements from one view into other views?**
- 3D measurements (e.g., visualizing a trace in axial, sagittal, and coronal views) are not currently supported in OHIF.
- Implementing 3D measurement is complex:
  - Linear measurements (e.g., length) may be possible with tricks like projection onto planes.
  - Bi-directional measurements are more challenging and would require extensive customization.
- Alternative visualizations (e.g., fading lines across slices) used in tools like Slicer were discussed but require heavy computations.
- Suggestions provided:
  - Develop a custom annotation tool for projection visualization.
  - Consider limitations and performance impact for real-time rendering.

🌀 **Is there anything new for linear fusion?**
- Updates related to linear fusion:
  - New features are being merged into Cornerstone, including GPU-based segmentation tools.
  - A "label map on MIP" (Maximum Intensity Projection) functionality is being developed.
  - Linear fusion will support ray tracing in MIP and label map interactions.
- GPU-based tools in Cornerstone include:
  - Grow Cut and Region Segment tools using WebGPU for fast 3D segmentation.
  - "Segment Anything" model integration with client-side processing using ONNX and WebGPU.

🔧 **Is there a way, or how would be the good way to make annotation auto-toggleable?**
- Current behavior: The measurement tool remains active until manually switched back to the stack scroll tool.
- Suggested solution:
  - Use an event listener to automatically switch tools after an annotation is created.
  - Code snippet:
    ```javascript
    eventTarget.addEventListener(cornerstoneTools.Enums.Events.ANNOTATION_ADDED, () => {
      const toolGroups = cornerstoneTools.ToolGroupManager.getAllToolGroups();
      toolGroups.forEach(toolGroup => {
        toolGroup.setToolPassive(cornerstoneTools.LengthTool.toolName);
        toolGroup.setToolActive(cornerstoneTools.StackScrollTool.toolName, {
          bindings: [
            {
              mouseButton: MouseBindings.Primary, // Left Click
            },
          ],
        });
      });
    });
    ```
  - Alternative: Bind annotation tools to specific keys (e.g., Shift, Control) or use hardware devices with enhanced input options.
- This functionality can be added in the extension's `init` file.
