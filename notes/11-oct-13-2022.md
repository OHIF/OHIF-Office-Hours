Issues with upgrade to OHIF v3 with some radiology studies

Trying to package OHIF v3 with Electron and React Native and enable local desktop based app
Can i use local storage for caching?

A: Old branch of OHIF v2 with Electron https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/commits/feat/electron with couchDB dicom server https://github.com/dcmjs-org/dicomweb-server Limitations are study list search not working

Static DICOM Web is also another option for the server https://github.com/RadicalImaging/Static-DICOMWeb/tree/master/packages/static-wado-webserver

OHIF v3 e2e tests are using the static DICOM Web
It fetches the data from our data repo yarn test:data

vtk.js api on implementation of the look up table

Interest in moving over touch event listener for Cornerstone3D
What the structure would look like

A: Touch event listener should be ported here https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstoneTools/blob/master/src/eventListeners/mouseEventListeners.js

It uses Hammer.js to augment the touch events.
We should do a research what can we use instead of Hammer.js since it seems to be not maintained anymore
