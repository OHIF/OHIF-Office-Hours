# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2023-03-16

## Q & A

### Clicking on volume viewport3d and change the other viewports based

Maybe look at MIP Jump To Click example? https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/mipjumptoclick

---

### Is there any plan to Delete Study from the server

Not in the immediate future.

---

### Hosting from a sub-directory for the OHIF v3

routerBasename in the config and PUBLIC_URL should be set correctly

---

### DICOM Segmentation object editing

Cornerstone3D developments are done https://www.cornerstonejs.org/docs/examples
we are working on the OHIF integration - will be added as new mode that lets you create the segmentation.

---

### Can isNegative flag be decided based on the scaling params

We can change to min and max calculation on the worker

---

### How to perform MIP on viewports that are not full MPR

See example https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/volumeapi

---

### Server-side rendered via Next.js can OHIF be part of it

Perhaps use the ‘use client’ flag in the Next.js?

https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components

---

### Any way to suppress the “cross origin isolation is not enabled” popup in the demo app?

showWarningMessageForCrossOrigin flag in the config

---

### Should we preserve camera information when changing layout

- How is the positioning/wl stored?
  - Currently stored by display set UID plus viewport initial information
- Proposal to store the information in two pieces:
  - Positioning - based on the display set UID + initial hanging protocol positioning specified
  - Window Level - based on the display set UID + initial hanging protocol window level specified
- General consensus is definite yes - the information should be displayed consistently/stored between views but not when
  a new series is getting dragged and dropped into the viewport
