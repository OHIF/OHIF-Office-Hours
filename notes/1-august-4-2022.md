  - set/apply the sigmoid function
  - legacy cornerstone has non linear look up table ([https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone/blob/master/src/internal/getVOILut.js#L40](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone/blob/master/src/internal/getVOILut.js#L40))
  - Initial implementation can be on setProperties [https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D-beta/blob/main/packages/core/src/RenderingEngine/StackViewport.ts#L544-L552](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D-beta/blob/main/packages/core/src/RenderingEngine/StackViewport.ts#L544-L552)
- SUV is showing up for the PT even if not scaled
