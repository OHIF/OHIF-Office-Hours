## Q & A

### How to get the cornerstone viewport (not OHIF viewport) maybe by the position and index for viewports?

Why the viewportId inside the HP protocol is not used as initial viewportId even when we don’t change layout or don’t change stage

ViewportId should be removed it is internal

If I need to grab the imageData from a viewport which I was previously able to do so by asking the RenderingEngine about the viewport by its id and then grab the imageData, I can’t now since viewportIds are basically random. How to achieve that? If it is the case that we can grab it by its index, it means the code should know about the positioning of the viewports at any time at any stage which is not ideal at all, since I want to grab the CT in stage1 which can be in position 1-1 but in stage 2 it can be in position 2-1, previously I was able to say just give the cs3d viewport with id of ‘ct’.

Maybe we need to change the viewportId on the HP to id and the internal viewportId to internalId
