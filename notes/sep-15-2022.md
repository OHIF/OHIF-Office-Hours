## Working with extension and modes outside of OHIF

Better separation of custom extensions, previously embedded in the same OHIF repo, but I want to leave it out. There are some link/dev issues

- Dev webpack is missing in the templates
- There were some issues with the CLI which is fixed, so maybe this fix it https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/2892

## Integrate OHIF v2 on mobile devices

react-vtkjs-viewport library seems to have problem on Safari.

- Chrome works fine

## Compression of DICOM files

What is the current status of compression of DICOM files support?

- All compression transfer syntaxes are supported
- New compression via HTJ2K will eventually be supported in CornerstoneWADOImageLoader, some initial work has been done in
- https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstoneWADOImageLoader/pull/451

## ID vs URI

Cornerstone3D Volume Image Loader is not the same as CornerstoneWADOImageLoader image loader, for the reason of performance
optimization. In the Volume Image Loader, we skip the image creation step and directly use the image data from the DICOM file
and insert it into the volume. This is a big performance improvement for large volumes. However, it might introduce
some difficulties regarding caching API and features.
