## One-line summaries
- üñºÔ∏è Asking how to implement MIP functionality like v2 in OHIF.
- üõ†Ô∏è Asking how to add slab thickness control back into the toolbox using the tutorial.

üñºÔ∏è **Good evening, grateful to be here. I am trying to come up with a MIP functionality like v2. Thats all Thanks**
- In OHIF Viewer, MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection) is currently under the crossers tool.
- In v2, there was a dedicated menu for MIP with controls for average, minimum, maximum, and slab thickness. That menu is not directly available in v3.
- Right now, MIP must be done manually via the crossers tool.
- With the new toolbar design, it‚Äôs easy to add back a dedicated MIP section similar to v2.
- The toolbar is designed to be flexible, so users or contributors can add their own toolbar sections.
- A PR (pull request) has been made to make modes more extensible:
  - This will allow configurations for modes with specific injected pieces.
  - You don‚Äôt need to rewrite the entire mode‚Äîonly add what you need.
- A dedicated MIP UI like v2 is not yet included, but could be added fairly easily in the near future.


üõ†Ô∏è **I have checked the toolbox tutorial and its cool, lets say i was to put a functionality and add the slab thickness control just to bring back**
- The basic viewer mode in OHIF is defined in the code under `modes/longitudinal`.
- Toolbar buttons are defined in `src/toolbarButtons`:
  - Each button is defined with properties like icon, label, tooltip, evaluator.
  - Placement of buttons in the toolbar happens in the `index`.
- To add slab thickness:
  - Define a new button called `slabThickness` in the toolbar buttons.
  - Provide an icon, label, and tooltip (translations for labels live in `i18n/locale` files).
  - Implement a UI for the button in the toolbar module of your extension (`getToolbarModule`).
  - In that UI, you‚Äôll have access to viewport managers and commands to manipulate slab thickness.
- Evaluators control when a button is active:
  - For example, ultrasound directional tools are only enabled for ultrasound modality.
  - A slab thickness tool should only be enabled when a volume viewport is active.
  - This can be checked via the viewport grid service.
- Slab thickness functionality is planned to return, but not immediately. For now, it can be implemented via a custom toolbar button following the above structure.
