# Questions & Answers

### üì∑ #Q1

There is a change of behavior in the image loading strategy, the interleaveTopToBottom was making loading image from top to bottom sequentially and interleaveNthLoader was loading intermediate slice to get a first low resolution rendering and then fill gaps between slice to increase resolution.
In a recent change related to htj2k, all loading became Nth. The InterleaveTopToBottom does not act like it was, loading sequentially each slice from top to bottom. 

The advantage of interleaveTopToBottom is that every part of the volume visible is fully loaded so a physician can eventually start to look at the first image of the top while the bottom is loading.

As it is now the issue is that the physician is forced to have a partial rendering and so will have to wait for the full image loading to be sure he is working on full resolution. 

I think it would be better to bring back the interleaveTopToBottom as the new loading was already covered by NthImage loader so the user can choose  between : 
NthImageloading to provide a fast overview of images, useful for non diagnostic use such as previews, case discussion etc ‚Ä¶
TopToButtom strategy in which each part of the available is fully loaded to secure the physician is working on full image quality (better for diagnosis use)

**Solutions Discussed:**

*   Allow the hanging protocol to specify the configuration for the progressive loading as a name configuration value.
*   Add another configuration that always did top to bottom, bottom to top, or middle outwards.
*   Add a flag that enables or disables progressive loading.
*   Implement a mechanism to subscribe to the "protocol changed" event from the hanging protocol service. This would allow changes to be made based on the chosen hanging protocol.


### üêû #Q2

Could you please fix this issue (also in v3.8)?
[Bug] DICOM_SEG masks are displayed only when selecting No for the prompt Do you want to open this Segmentation?
[https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4342#issuecomment-2337883274](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4342#issuecomment-2337883274)

There is also a comment in the thread with a possible solution.
[https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4342#issuecomment-2337883274](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4342#issuecomment-2337883274)

Thanks in advance.


**Solutions Discussed:**

*   The issue is related to changes in the segmentation behavior, particularly in regards to hydration.
*   A possible solution involves modifying the `getSegmentations` function in the `PanelSegmentation` component to set the `filterNonHydratedSegmentations` argument to `false`. This would ensure all segmentations are displayed.
*   The fix is planned for the 3.9 version and will not be backported to 3.8 due to the significant changes involved.



### üì± #Q3

Any idea of what could be causing a rerender of the page on different phones when loading different CTA's using the nifti volume loader

There are no immediate errors, but the page refreshes right after the loading is done when you try to Load a CTA, and generally works fine with NCCTs (smaller images in size)

The CTAs are compressed already, and it's generally fine to load one, but multiple with load and cache seems to fill the cache real quick (I presume that is what is happening but am not sure)

It only happens on mobile?


**Solutions Discussed:**

*   The issue is likely related to browser behavior rather than OHIF's functionality.
*   It was suggested to test with different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge) to check if the behavior persists.
*   The possibility of a React rendering issue due to a weird error was raised.
*   It was suggested to use the Safari developer tools or Chrome's debugging tools for mobile applications to inspect the stack trace and pinpoint the source of the re-render.



### ‚úÖ #Q4

Just wanted to inform you that PR is ready to trigger the STACK_SCROLL_OUT_OF_BOUNDS event in the StackViewport scroll function.
[https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/1465](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/1465)
It would be much appreciated if you can review ASAP, thanks.


**Solutions Discussed:**

*   The question was a notification about a pull request related to the `STACK_SCROLL_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` event in Cornerstone3D. 
*   The main solution is the PR itself.
*   The response was a placeholder answer awaiting the review.


### ‚òÅÔ∏è #Q5

Looking for general hints on improving OHIF/Orthanc speed on AWS. The query speed in the cloud using postgres is more than an order of magnitude slower than a local docker using sqlite. I‚Äôve tried various options for specifying the dicom tags in the Orthanc configuration but haven‚Äôt noticed a difference. How can I get the query speed to increase?
For ~ 150 studies - a local /studies? Query might take 300msec; in the cloud this might be 8000 or more msec. 

Bill> Please provide timings on which queries exactly are slow, e.g. study query?
Ibrahim> You can try using CloudFront with a proper cache key setup, and a lambda to warm up the cache/invalidate the cache if needed. It won‚Äôt solve the problem entirely since requests that are not in the cache will still take a long time.


**Solutions Discussed:**

*   RDS configuration can significantly impact performance. The default configuration for cheaper RDS instances might not be optimal.
*   Consult online guides for optimizing RDS performance on AWS.
*   Consider increasing the RDS instance's resource allocation (e.g., memory) for better performance, which will come with increased costs.
*   Explore setting up RDS reservations to ensure a certain amount of preloaded data is available.
*   Evaluate if caching can be implemented in the Orthanc deployment to avoid repeated queries to the database. Nginx caching can be used as a front-end solution.
*   Consider using a local Postgres instance on the EC2 instance where Orthanc runs, coupled with an EVS volume for data storage, and compare the performance with the managed RDS service.


### ‚¨ú #Q6

Pathology reports are not viewing properly a white square is showing. I can screen share.


**Solutions Discussed:**

*   The issue is related to the viewer mode used for the study.
*   Instead of using the basic viewer, the microscopy mode should be used for viewing pathology reports.
*   The microscopy mode provides the correct view, and the basic viewer results in patches or a white screen.
*   The microscopy viewer in OHIF 3.9 leverages Cornerstone for rendering, enabling features like panning, zooming, and layout changes.


### üõ†Ô∏è #Q7

Trying to implement CTR into OHIF by creating a new button in the More Tools section, registering it into the toolbar, and creating some files for the tool in cornerstone/src and cornerstone-dicom-sr/src directories. Is it necessary to create two files with the same content in those two different directories or is there any other way to only create one CTRTool file and import it to those two directories? Because it produced an error when I put CTRTool.ts file in one directory and imported it to the other, and vice versa. As for the functionality, I tried to copy and paste another tool‚Äôs code (I‚Äôve tried bidirectional, length, and cobb angle) into those new CTRTool files to test the button but it gave me so many errors that says I don‚Äôt have the appropriate loader to load the file.  How can I fix this error?


**Solutions Discussed:**

*   To add a new tool button to the OHIF toolbar, refer to the documentation on `docs.ohif.org` (Extensions, Modules, Toolbar).
*   The process involves defining the button (icon, label, command) and positioning it within a toolbar section.
*   The `primary` section is a predefined section, but custom sections can be created and buttons added to them.
*   The errors encountered when clicking the button might be due to the implementation of the tool itself, as it's not clear what the `ctrtool.ts` file contains.
*   It was suggested to start by working with a Cornerstone example (like the `Stack Annotation Tools` example) to isolate the tool functionality before integrating it into OHIF. This approach simplifies debugging and iteration.


### üñ•Ô∏è #Q8

I am pre downloading studies for loading studies faster. It would only download studies till max 9 days(based on user prefs) for this you guys said to make a Web server but how can I load the other studies from the cloud that aren‚Äôt downloaded? 

NOTE: I am doing this on an Electron app which I converted from a Next.js web app.


**Solutions Discussed:**

*   The web server could act as a caching proxy for the remote system. Pre-caching data for 9 days and downloading the rest as needed.
*   The Electron app needs to determine how to find the list of available studies. 
*   When a study is opened, the web server (or a different mechanism) could query the API for the current study and download related or prior studies in the background.
*   Consider using Electron worker threads for multi-threading to handle background downloads.
*   OHIF currently doesn't have a built-in mechanism to switch between data sources based on local cache availability.
*   A possible solution is to create a middleware or change the OHIF data source configuration to accommodate multiple data sources and determine the priority of each.
*   A more robust solution involves creating a composite data source that knows how to query both local and remote data sources and merge the results. The `merge data source` API might offer a good foundation for this.



### üîÑ #Q9

I am trying to start old LesionTracker, kind of hard to do it. Saw that you also had an exec for windows. Is that still available somewhere to download?


**Solutions Discussed:**

*   No specific solution was discussed in the transcript as the context was related to a separate tool rather than core OHIF.
*   The transcript states "kind of hard to do it" and refers to an executable for windows.
*   The question is about the availability of a Windows executable of the tool.
