## Q & A

Q:
Performance issues with request pool manager (not 100% sure if it is the pool)

There are certain priorities and within each there are orders

Sometimes the user will interact (assume there are a lot of prefetch requests), interaction is fired but the bandwidth is full.

Maybe we should cancel ongoing requests of less priority?

A:
In Canceling client needs to send cancel request to server, and by that time server has buffered the response. So basically, canceling/suspend might not be ideal

Gigabit bandwidth helps a lot for sure for client side rendering.

HTj2K can encode with TLM markers so that later during decode you can say give me 128x128, then to 256x256

Progressive loading might be the solution

Q: Idea of Slab viewport for StackScroll for extremely large volumes that don’t fit into WebGL
Is it worth to treat volume as stack (like 32 slices),

512x512x1300 Slice that doesn’t fit in memory

A: We added PRs vtk.js for norm16 and half float recently that might help. But the idea seems
interesting.
