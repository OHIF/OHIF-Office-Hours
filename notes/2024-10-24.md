## Q & A

Attendees: 14

Discussed:


- 🤖 Guidance needed for implementing SAM model integration with point/box annotations
- 🎨 How to display AI segmentation results in the viewer
- 📏 Adding slice thickness display to viewport overlay
- 🔄 Proper viewport orientation modification through ViewportGridService
- 🎚️ Setting default window level values programmatically
- 🔄 Accessing latest development releases and versions
- 📅 Timeline for OHIF 3.9 and Cornerstone 2.0 release
- 🔄 Migration guidance from react-vtkjs-viewport to Cornerstone3D
- ℹ️ Understanding TMTV patient information sources and editing behavior
- 🔄 Current and planned image fusion capabilities in OHIF


🤖 **We are working on implementing Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for automatic segmentation. Could you provide guidance on how to create a bounding box or a point on an image to pass to the AI for processing and obtaining results?**
- Tools available for creating points and bounding boxes:
  - Probe tool for points
  - Rectangle tool for bounding boxes
- Can access coordinates through cornerstone tools API:
  - `cornerstoneTools.annotation.state.getAllAnnotations()`
  - Coordinates available in world and image coordinate systems
- Conversion utilities available between coordinate systems
- New segment editing features coming in November release

🎨 **Once we receive the results from the AI, how can we effectively display the segmented areas on the viewer?**
- Use segmentation services to hydrate results into viewer
- Reference implementation available in MONAI Label plugin
- Example code provided for parsing and displaying segmentation data:
```javascript
const ret = SegmentationReader.parseNrrdData(response.data);
// [Rest of code snippet as provided in original]
```
- https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/plugins/ohifv3

📏 **How to show slice thickness of the current instance on the viewer**
- Use customization service for viewport overlays
- Configure through customizationService settings
- Example configuration provided:
```javascript
customizationService: [
   {
     id: '@ohif/cornerstoneOverlay',
     // [Rest of configuration as provided]
   }
]
```

🔄 **I'm using the onViewportDataInitialized callback in the Hanging Protocol service to executed a command that modifies the orientation of one of the displayed viewports. I'm modifying the viewport via the CornerstoneViewportService, but I'm noticing the orientation change is not reflected in the ViewportGridService state. Should I be modifying the viewport via a different mechanism to ensure this state gets updated?**
- Modifications should go through ViewportGridService
- Use setDisplaySets for viewport with orientation options
- ViewportGridService handles internal updates to cornerstone viewport

🎚️ **How can we set default WW/WL values?**
- Use viewport API to set properties
- Access through cornerstone viewport service
- Can set VUI range with lower/upper values
- Map to reset command for button functionality

🔄 **Where can I find and try out the latest dev releases?**
- Master branch contains latest development version (beta)
- Stable releases available in release branches
- Documentation available at: https://docs.ohif.org/development/getting-started/#branches
- Current version tracking in viewer-dev.ohif.org

📅 **Can you please share the next release date for OHIF 3.9 and are we including cornerstone 2.0 as part of this release?**
- OHIF 3.9 release planned after QA completion
- Will include Cornerstone 2.0
- Timeline: couple of days after QA completion
- Both releases coordinated together

🔄 **In our company, we're using a viewer based on the outdated library https://github.com/OHIF/react-vtkjs-viewport, and we ran into some low level issues when updating libraries (vtk.js, node.js) that are hard for us to solve. We hence consider migrating to cornerstone3D. Do you have any hints / documentation on how to perform such a migration, or do you know a person that could support us with that?**
- Migration recommended due to:
  - Unified tooling system
  - Improved performance
  - Better memory management
- Reference implementation: https://viewer-v2-legacy.ohif.org/pwa/
- Consider complete rewrite vs. migration
- Commercial support available through Radical Imaging

ℹ️ **Questions about the Patient Information tab in the TMTV mode:**
- Values pulled from DICOM tags
- Metadata providers handle specific PET-related calculations
- Editing values triggers recalculation of SUV
- Documentation: https://docs.ohif.org/faq/technical#what-are-the-list-of-required-metadata-for-the-ohif-viewer-to-work

🔄 **What are the current fusion capabilities of OHIF (e.g. to overlay a PET and a CT), can it only be done through the TMTV mode, or is there another way to do it in the viewer?**
- Currently limited to hanging protocols (like TMTV)
- Requires same frame of reference for fusion
- New fusion menu planned for 3.10 release
- Will include opacity controls between modalities
