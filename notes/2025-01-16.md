#### üõ†Ô∏è **I‚Äôd like to use my own UI components for notifications, modals, dialogs, etc. and am struggling to understand the best way to do this. For customizing the notification/modal/dialog components used by the default and cornerstone extensions, I think I need to add a customization service call to allow me to override the default OHIF components with my own. Is this the case?**
- Yes, this can be achieved by overriding the default OHIF components. You can either:
  - Use the customization service to define your own components.
  - Create a new implementation of the service and extend the existing one by calling `super` for default behaviors while adding your custom methods.
  - Completely replace the UI service if major structural changes are needed.
- Refer to [OHIF customization documentation](https://docs.ohif.org) for more details.

---

#### üß© **I‚Äôm also struggling to understand how to apply the guidance from the UI Services documentation. For instance, when should I set a service implementation on the existing service vs. create a new provider for the service vs. create a new service entirely?**
- Use a service implementation if you are only extending or modifying the behavior of the existing service (e.g., adding methods or properties).
- Use a new service entirely if you plan to introduce completely new logic or if the original service cannot fulfill your requirements.
- Providers are needed when you need reactivity for UI state (e.g., managing UI layout responsiveness). 
- Example: For a UI modal service, simple extension works fine, but viewport grids often need both a provider and a service for state management.

#### üåê **Two issues related to PUBLIC_URL to discuss:**
- Issues raised in GitHub:  
  - [Issue #4692: Broken root due to required PUBLIC_URL](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4692)  
  - [Issue #4690: Hardcoded paths for icon microscopy](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4690)  
- The solution involves ensuring the `PUBLIC_URL` is included in routes or documented clearly for users with custom routes.
- A proposed fix includes documenting the necessity of `PUBLIC_URL` in custom builds or improving route registration to make it dynamic.

---

#### üñºÔ∏è **I would like help with some errors we are seeing on our system when attempting to load segmentations into the OHIF viewer. Are there any guidelines/examples we can follow to verify that the segmentations we created are valid?**
- Verify DICOM segmentations with tools like:
  - [VolView](https://volview.kitware.app/): A VTK-based viewer to check if the segmentation loads correctly.
  - [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org): Drag and drop your files to check data integrity.
- If issues persist:
  - Test the segmentation on the OHIF Viewer beta branch ([viewer-dev](https://viewer-dev.ohif.org)).
  - Create a GitHub issue and share the segmentation files via Dropbox or another service for analysis.
- You are already using `pydicom` to generate segmentations, so ensure that undefined fields or reference misalignments are addressed.

---

#### üìä **We are looking to default to the ‚Äú3D Four-Up view‚Äù in the viewport when the app finishes loading. How do we achieve this?**
- Use a hanging protocol to set the default viewport configuration:
  - Append `hangingProtocolId=fourUp` to the URL:
    ```
    https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/viewer?StudyInstanceUIDs=...&hangingProtocolId=fourUp
    ```
  - Alternatively, configure your mode factory to enforce a specific hanging protocol:
    ```javascript
    hangingProtocol: 'fourUp',
    ```

---

#### üîç **Could we do an overview of how we can add contrast/brightness and sharpness to an image in the new version of Cornerstone?**
- For contrast and brightness:
  - Adjust `voiRange` in the viewport's properties:
    ```javascript
    viewport.setProperties({ voiRange: { lower, upper } });
    ```
  - Refer to `packages/core/src/utilities/windowLevel.ts` for related math.
  - Brightness and contrast can also be derived from window-level (center and width).
- For sharpness:
  - Implement image convolution filters using `canvas` or `FeConvolveMatrix` (SVG filter).
  - Example of canvas manipulation:
    ```javascript
    const canvas = document.querySelector('.cornerstone-canvas');
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    const imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    // Apply custom sharpness logic here
    ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
    ```
  - Look into [VideoViewport](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D) for applying filters during rendering.

---

#### üß™ **Are there any tools for debugging/looking into Cornerstone state, and how do we manage that relationship with state management tools (e.g., Redux)?**
- To inspect Cornerstone state:
  - Assign Cornerstone to the window for debugging:
    ```javascript
    window.cornerstone = cornerstone;
    console.log(cornerstone.getRenderingEngines());
    ```
  - Use helper methods to extract viewport state (`getRenderingEngines`, `getViewports`).
- State synchronization:
  - Avoid duplicating state in Cornerstone and Redux. Choose one as the source of truth.
  - For example, use Redux for UI-related states and Cornerstone for viewport-specific states.

---

#### üîÑ **For updating calculations on an annotation, how do you handle image orientation/directionality (e.g., image flips/rotates)?**
- Annotations are stored in world coordinates, ensuring consistency regardless of flips, rotations, or camera adjustments.
- Cornerstone tools automatically handle rendering adjustments via:
  - `worldToCanvas` and `canvasToWorld` functions for accurate positioning.
- For custom tools:
  - Ensure `worldToCanvas` and `canvasToWorld` are implemented for the viewport.
  - Re-trigger annotation renders if necessary:
    ```javascript
    cornerstone.triggerAnnotationRenderForViewportId(viewportId);
    ```

---

#### ‚ûï **resetCrosshair and again re-enable it using the same button:**
- Use `setToolActive` and `setToolDisabled` methods on tool groups:
  ```javascript
  toolGroup.setToolActive('Crosshair');
  toolGroup.setToolDisabled('Crosshair');
  ```

---

#### üìÇ **If multiple instance octet streams (more than two) in a single response, how can I map these with metadata and load them in stack/volume viewport?**
- Implement a streaming HTTP parser to split and handle multi-part responses.
- Reference `packages/core/src/loaders/ProgressiveRetrieveImages.ts` as an example.
- Create a custom image loader and parser to map metadata and pixel data.

---

#### üß† **Increased memory footprint due to VoxelManager in volume rendering. Why is VoxelManager adding memory overhead?**
- VoxelManager stores additional data, causing duplication with `imageFrame.pixelData`.
- Suggested fix: Use `imageFrame.pixelData` directly to reduce memory usage.
- Submit a pull request with your workaround to start a discussion.

---

#### üîî **What is the right event to listen for when a new viewport is mounted/ready?**
- Use `viewportService.EVENTS.VIEWPORT_MOUNTED` or `viewportService.EVENTS.VIEWPORT_READY`.
- Alternatively, trigger updates manually with `triggerAnnotationRenderForViewportId`.
