## Q & A

## When to create a new datasource type vs configuration parameters for an existing one? I have a datastore which requires configuration stored in browser local storage. If this configuration is not present, my datasource fails to initialize (createDataSource throws Error) and the “Something went wrong” page is displayed. How can I display my own configuration page when this happens?

There are various ways to configure and re-initialize a datasource. You can see the PR

https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/3543

To learn more about new additions.

An alternative would be using the customization service https://docs.ohif.org/platform/services/ui/customization-service

Also you can use onConfiguration for the data source

### We have configured the OHIF viewer to use a locally hosted Orthanc as a datasource. When we try saving measurements from a basic viewer, the SR gets saved as a separate study as mentioned in this github issue, which makes both the SR and the original DICOM studies inaccessible. Where could this issue be originating from, and any pointers to possible solutions would be greatly appreciated!

Seems like your base is an old OHIF

### Any plan to release V3 as NPM package? I see the current npm package is for V2.

You should use @ohif/app npm package and NOT the @ohif/viewer

### How does one go about troubleshooting issues with the google.js configuration? I'm having issues with the data not being shown on the study list because I assume it can't find the datastore or isn't being allowed access to it. And are there any plans to create a UI view for Google Healthcare in V3 similar to the one in

Take a look into credentials page in the GCP and make use the URI and callbacks are set correctly

Authorized JavaScript origins

E.g., http://localhost:3000

And

Authorized redirect URIs

http://localhost:3000/callback

### What is the recommended way to integrate only the viewer portion of OHIF in another web app that wraps additional features around the viewer (for example, custom dashboards, authentication and access-controlled studylists)?

You should use an iframe

https://docs.ohif.org/deployment/iframe

routerBasename: '/dashboard/viewer',and PUBLIC_URL let you serve the viewer from different route

Take a look here https://docs.ohif.org/deployment/iframe/#static-build

### What is the recommended way to create our own stackPrefetch method? We are trying to prefetch(load and cache stack images) in background for all series with some priorities(e.g, the series in active hanging protocol, active study, and so on)

There was studyPrefetcher in OHIF v2 which had many bugs. We should rework it and bring it to the OHIF. Also we should take into account the position (currentImageIdIndex) of viewports when cache wants to overwrite old images.
