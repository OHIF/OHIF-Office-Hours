# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2023-09-21

## Q & A

### Q: I am experiencing slowness when I load multiframe BTO studies. How can I measure image download/cache time, decompression time, and rendering time?

**A:** You might find Pull Request 667 to be helpful for tackling this issue.

---

### Q: How can I change the UI theme without altering the OHIF core code, preferably via an extension?

**A:** Modifying Tailwind via extensions is not straightforward. Your best option might be to directly update the `tailwind.config.js` file. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/OHIF/config-point).

---

### Q: How can I use OHIF's existing annotations through an extension?

**A:** You should check out the DICOM SR restore code, as it takes DICOM Structured Reporting objects and converts them back into Cornerstone 3D or OHIF annotations, which are then rendered on the display.

---

### Q: If I alter the source code of Cornerstone 3D, how can I build it and integrate it with OHIF?

**A:** The documentation on OHIF development, specifically the [link section](https://docs.ohif.org/development/link), could guide you on how to go about this.

---

### Q: How can I use a custom backend that supplies DICOM instances compatible with OHIF?

**A:** You should follow the DICOM JSON data source documentation. When initializing the mode, you should set your own implementation of the user authentication service.

---

### Q: What exactly is a displaySet in OHIF?

**A:** A displaySet is a generalized collection of entities that includes links to various objects that can be displayed, such as images. The concept is mostly used in the context of hanging protocols, where users might want to view different series in a particular arrangement.

---

### Q: How can I run OHIF in development with different routerBasename than /?

**A:** To accomplish this, you should look into the `devServer` configuration within the `webpack.pwa.js` file. For more details, visit [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).

---

### Q: I'm embedding OHIF in an iFrame and am encountering issues with custom configurations not taking effect.

**A:** The problem might be that the `onload` event fires before OHIF is fully loaded and capable of accepting new configurations. A potential solution is to have the iFrame inform the parent window when it is ready to receive the new configuration. Additionally, you can use the `onConfiguration` hook in the app's configuration file to solve this issue.
