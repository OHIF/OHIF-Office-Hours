1) Questions and summarized answers:

üñºÔ∏è **Q: Image loaders / metadata loaders relation
curious whether you can explain a bit more about the relationship between image loaders and metadata loaders
without metadata (pixel module, etc), an image cannot be rendered
in my head, it makes sense that once an image is loaded by the imageloader, it also provides its metadata
i.e. it would be the responsibility of any image loader to provide metadata?
why are imageloaders and metadata loaders split? can you provide some thoughts / use-cases / examples / outliers?**

A:
- Image loaders and metadata loaders are not always the same
- In WADO-URI, one loader handles both image and metadata
- In WADO-RS, separate endpoints exist for metadata and pixel data
  - Allows for better performance in initial viewer setup and hanging protocols
- Metadata providers have a ranking system for priority
- Multiple providers can exist, allowing for custom metadata sources
- In WADO-RS, metadata is often loaded separately from images
- For volume loading, metadata is used to determine volume properties
- Custom loaders may need to handle both metadata and image loading

üîç **Q: I'm trying to render a volume in volume viewports but am encountering the bug described by: https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/886, only I'm using a custom image loader I wrote (for what it's worth, this loader calls the DICOM Image Loader). I don't think the issue is scaling related because my volumes are all filled with 0s. I started looking for the code that handles copying data from the image's arraybuffer into the volume, but I can't figure out where this is. Any tips for how to troubleshoot?**

A:
- The issue is likely related to SharedArrayBuffer handling
- Turning off SharedArrayBuffer in the configuration may resolve the issue temporarily
- In Cornerstone3D 2.0 (coming soon), SharedArrayBuffer usage is being removed
- Custom image loaders need to handle SharedArrayBuffer if it's enabled:
  - Receive SharedArrayBuffer in options
  - Calculate offset and write to the correct location in the buffer
- Without SharedArrayBuffer, the main thread handles writing to the volume
- Cornerstone3D 2.0 will simplify this process
- Reference PRs for improvements:
  - https://github.com/sgielen/cornerstone3D/pull/1
  - https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/832

üìä **Q: How to get all images to addAnnotations with cs3dTools.annotation.state.addAnnotation(...) ? Today, I have an issue about a wrong targetId something strange. I use this to have imageId: "const imageId = viewport.getCurrentImageId()"**

A:
- Recommended to use the annotation hydration utility
- Located in the utilities of tools
- Handles various issues related to adding annotations programmatically
- Usage: Provide viewport, tool name, world positions, and options
- Reference: packages/tools/src/utilities/annotationHydration.ts

üìè **Q: Hello everyone, i'm experiencing an issue with measurements across different series in the same ultrasound (US) study modality. Specifically, when I have measurements from different series or when working with structured reports (SR) across series, there's some unusual behavior with the measurement button.
Issue: When I click on a measurement that belongs to the currently active series in the viewport, it correctly jumps to the frame number and shows the measurement.
Problem: However, when I click on a measurement from a different series (one that is not currently active in the viewport), it requires a double-click to function properly. The first click changes the active series but only shows the first frame, and only on the second click does it navigate to the correct frame with the measurement.**

A:
- This issue is related to multi-frame handling in the jump logic
- The problem is in the viewport grid component, specifically in the jump to measurement layout function
- Current comparison assumes correct image based on SOP instance UID, which is insufficient for multi-frame
- Recent changes in the viewer-dev version have improved this:
  - Uses set view reference for more complete jumping
  - Handles different types of images (e.g., pathology, whole slide imaging, video)
- To test and report:
  - Use the ultrasound study available in the OHIF demo data
  - File an issue with reproducible steps using this data
- Reference: https://docs.ohif.org/development/getting-started/#branches

üî¨ **Q: As mentioned in today's meeting, Cornerstone can support creating volume with just first, middle and last image's metadata.
However, from an OHIF perspective, don't we still need all slice spacing verification from OHIF, which requires all image's metadata to determine whether the displayset is reconstructable? 
Is there any way to determine reconstructability without loading all instances' metadata?**

A:
- OHIF has more comprehensive logic for volume reconstruction than Cornerstone
- OHIF checks for:
  - Consistent spacing in all directions
  - Average spacing between slices
  - Maximum texture size limitations
- Cornerstone's approach (using first, middle, and last image) may not be sufficient for OHIF's needs
- Suggestion: Bring OHIF's logic into Cornerstone for better consistency
- Reference: isDisplaySetReconstructable.js#L166-L189

üîÑ **Q: You mentioned cornerstone 3D 2.0 changes next week regarding metadata providers/image loading/volume loading (e.g. SharedArrayBuffer), could you show a bit where we're going?**

A:
- Migration guides for Cornerstone3D 2.0 have been recently updated (not yet merged)
- Key changes include:
  - Removal of SharedArrayBuffer usage
  - Improvements to metadata providers and image loading
  - Simplified volume loading process
- Full details will be available in the upcoming migration guide
- A video explaining the changes is planned
