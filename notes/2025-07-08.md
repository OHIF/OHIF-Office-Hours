# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2025-07-08

## Q & A

attendees: 12


### One-line summaries
- üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting 3.10 segmentation tools like label-assist and one-click segmentation in browser.
- üåÄ Investigating StackViewport behavior with gantry tilt and how Cornerstone3D handles slice orientation.
- üîí Addressing changes in handling the `isLocked` field for annotations during OHIF upgrade from 3.9 to 3.10.

üõ†Ô∏è **Check 3.10 segmentation tool (label-assist - does not work, one-click segment(3d Growcut, limited- PET case)**  
- The 3.10 segmentation tools, including one-click segmentation and Copilot, run entirely in the browser‚Äîno server involved.
  - One-click uses a GrowCut algorithm and works best for PET scans or solid-structured regions.
  - If it doesn't work, it may be due to the device, modality, or region not being suitable for segmentation.
- The UI indicates if segmentation is possible with a ‚Äú+‚Äù sign before you click.
- Copilot segmentation uses a "segment anything" model also run in-browser. Users draw a region and scroll to preview predictions slice-by-slice.
  - Press `Enter` to accept, `Esc` to skip. The accept function is currently buggy but being optimized.
- Bigger, more defined structures (e.g., liver) yield better results; small or vague regions struggle.
- Users can edit segmentations and guide the tool by marking predictions as wrong/right.
- The model used was originally trained on cats and dogs; users can ‚Äúbring their own model‚Äù trained on CT/MR.
- Three model sizes exist: ~200MB (default), 1.16GB, and 2.38GB‚Äîonly the small one is deployed.
- Region segment tools allow configuring seeds, island removal, and heuristics.
- Advanced segmentation can be done via MONAI Label integration (requires a GPU server).

üåÄ **I‚Äôm using Cornerstone3D with a StackViewport to render DICOM series via wadouri: imageIds (not volumes). When I load a CT series that includes gantry tilt (i.e., angled slices), it seems like Cornerstone is automatically applying some correction to ‚Äústraighten‚Äù or align the stack. Is this expected behavior when using setStack() on a StackViewport? If so, what part of the pipeline or metadata is responsible for that compensation? And is there a way to disable this and render the images with their original slice orientation (e.g., visibly tilted as acquired)?**
- Yes, StackViewport should just display raw images as acquired, even for oblique acquisitions like gantry tilt.
- If the output looks corrected/straightened, it may be due to incorrect orientation metadata.
  - Specifically, setting orientation to "axial" manually causes misalignment in StackViewport.
- StackViewport should use acquisition orientation by default.
- Recommendation:
  - Try dragging just the first slice into the viewer to see if the full FOV renders correctly.
  - If not, anonymize and submit the DICOM + issue.
- Root cause might be:
  - Misconfigured acquisition orientation.
  - VolumeViewport behaving differently than StackViewport.

üîí **I am migrating OHIF from 3.9 to 3.10. In the new version the ‚ÄúisLocked‚Äù field is different from before. Thanks for the 1st reply on Slack : ‚Äúdon't modify the state manualy, use the locked api‚Äù but to do that (with setAnnotationLocked) I need the annotation UID which is not returned by createAndAddAnnotation. How should I do that?**
- The `createAndAddAnnotation` function doesn‚Äôt return the UID directly.
- Recommendation: use the `addAnnotation()` function instead, which returns the UID.
- For Rectangle annotations:
  - Use the static `hydrate()` method to load annotations into a specific viewport.
  - You can specify `isLocked` and other options in this method.
- Suggestion: submit a PR to include `isLocked` in the annotation creation step across all tools.
  - Include `isVisible` too while at it.
- Until then, modify the code to return UID from creation or switch to `addAnnotation`.
