### ‚ùå **The context menu that contains ‚Äúdelete measurement,‚Äù ‚Äúadd label‚Äù options does not close on outside click, especially when a tool is active.**
- This issue has already been fixed on the master branch.
- You can check the latest development version at: [viewer-dev.ohif.org](https://viewer-dev.ohif.org).
- PR reference: [https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/4627](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/4627).

### üîò **I would like to raise a PR to delete a measurement via clicking the delete button. The method to delete a measurement right now is to open the context menu and then click the ‚Äúdelete measurement‚Äù option.**
- The current workflow to delete a measurement can be extended using a hotkey configuration:
  - In your configuration, define a hotkey in the `keys` section (e.g., `keys: ["delete"]`) with the command labeled as `deleteMeasurement`.
  - Use the cornerstone selection API to target the active annotation.
  - Example command setup: 
    ```javascript
    {
      commandName: 'deleteSelectedMeasurement',
      action: () => {
        const annotation = cornerstoneTools.getFirstAnnotationSelected();
        if (annotation) {
          cornerstoneTools.removeAnnotation(annotation);
        }
      }
    }
    ```
- Hotkeys also support combinations using libraries like `mousetrap` (e.g., `Shift + Delete` or `Ctrl + Z`).
- PRs are welcome for this feature.

### ü§î **Wanted to know your thoughts on trame and if it is aiming to replicate OHIF since it was part of the NA-MIC Project Weeks.**
- The team doesn't have much information on `trame` to provide an informed opinion.

---

### üìè **Wanted to know why the length property of the spline changes when I resize the window. The points are in the control points and curve points are in the canvas coordinate space.**
- The length property of the spline is affected because the control points and curve points are in canvas coordinate space, which can change with resizing.
- It‚Äôs suggested to run the `splineROI` example locally to isolate whether this is an issue with your custom tool or a bug in the base implementation.
- If it's determined to be a bug, providing a standalone example would help the team address it.

---

### ‚úÖ **Can we check these two simple PRs?**
1. **[PR 4589](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/4589)**:
   - Discusses differences between `setProtocol` and `run` methods in the hang protocol system.
   - The `run` method selects the most appropriate stage/layout dynamically, while `setProtocol` applies a specific protocol directly.
   - Action: The team will review the internal implementation to prevent duplicate callback execution.

2. **[PR 4644](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/4644)**:
   - Updates the metadata fetching API to handle cases where `seriesInstanceUID` is provided but `studyInstanceUID` is null or undefined.
   - Action: The team agreed to modify the condition to check for `null` and ensure compatibility.

### üåê **I managed to put together some code to load local DICOM studies and wanted to know if you're interested in looking at it for demonstrating the capability. One of the requirements was to run it in Azure Storage Blob as a static website.**
- This approach replaces the need for CD-ROMs by providing patients with a URL containing the OHIF viewer and their DICOM Part 10 files.
- Feedback from the team:
  - This is an exciting solution; PRs or documentation to showcase this capability are welcome.
  - The team mentioned it would be valuable to create a "recipe" for building such a deployment.

### üñ•Ô∏è **In scenarios where images are stored by Orthanc container on AWS S3, is there any potential performance advantage in running an OHIF container on a separate higher-powered host? Or is it best to run an OHIF container on the same host as Orthanc?**
- OHIF doesn‚Äôt require high computational power as it‚Äôs a static site.
- Suggestions:
  - Deploy OHIF to S3 and use CloudFront for CDN distribution to reduce costs.
  - Orthanc should compress files (e.g., using zip) and serve with proper headers to allow caching.
  - Reference: [Static DICOM Web Tools](https://docs.ohif.org/configuration/datasources/static-files/) and [Radical Imaging Static DICOMWeb](https://github.com/RadicalImaging/Static-DICOMWeb).

### üìâ **To load the cornerstone volumeViewport3D example on iPhone 13, the memory peak is around 800 MB, stabilizing at 600 MB. The data size is around 150‚Äì160 MB. Is there any way to optimize this memory with voxelManager?**
- Key observations:
  - The peak memory usage is expected due to 3D rendering processes.
  - Cornerstone 2.0 already optimizes memory by using textures rather than keeping the entire volume in memory.
- Suggestions:
  - Check `voxelManager` logic, particularly the WebGL `updateTextureImage` function, to ensure slices are cleared once uploaded to GPU memory.
  - Investigate WebGL extensions like `TEXTURE_NORM16` for performance variability across devices.
  - The team is considering adding an async initialization check in future versions to better handle compatibility with hardware.
