## Q & A

### How to set the new viewport to a volume

A: There is a defaultViewport that specifies what happens when a new viewport is asked to be hung change that to volume and also under stages.viewports change viewportType to volume.

viewportType can be also a custom attribute, it needs to be a named function that you register with HangingProtocolService
