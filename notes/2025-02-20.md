## Questions and Summarized Answers  

### 📹 **Want to get some guidance on this PR addressing video segmentations. I have a couple more questions. Placing them at the bottom.**  
- The discussion in the transcript suggests that video segmentation reference images need proper handling.  
- There may be an issue with how the reference image ID is applied across frames.  
- It was noted that `isViewRef` works in some cases but might require additional data beyond the referenced image ID.  
- Debugging efforts included setting up an external DICOMweb server to monitor JSON responses, but attempts to manually store and return responses did not work.

### 📡 **We are trying to create a custom datasource in the OHIF viewer which is backed by a proprietary data model. Our investigation into the viewer using a DICOMweb datasource shows the datasource is transforming the data provided by a DICOMweb server into another format for the viewer. Can anyone direct us to documentation about the data structure the datasource returns that is required by the viewer?**  
- No direct documentation was referenced in the transcript.  
- The discussion mentioned that data transformation occurs, including changes in JSON keys from DICOM IDs to human-friendly labels.  
- Understanding how `iWeb API` data sources interact with OHIF is key.

### 🎥 **How can I auto play the instances on an Echo study like kind of a video?**  
-Take a look at autoCineEnabled and how we do that in activeViewportBehaviour in OHIFCornerstoneViewport and use cineService.playClip

---  

### 🏥 **These are some tools that doctors are using during Echo reporting, are these available in OHIF and if not what can be done?**  
- We need to look at the videos of each tool to be able to answer this question.

---  

### 📏 **Z component of probe measurement is flipped in different layout, such as MPR, 3D main.**  
🔗 [GitHub Issue #4795](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4795)  
- The transcript discusses sorting functions and how slice positioning is determined.  
- It suggests that displaying `image position patient` in the probe tool may help maintain consistency across different views.  

---  

### 🔍 **Cannot choose and hide/show segmentation in 3D viewport.**  
🔗 [GitHub Issue #4796](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4796)  
- The transcript indicates that there is limited control over segment visibility in some viewports.  
- `setSegmentIndexVisibility` was mentioned as a function that may be relevant.  
- Some workarounds exist for label maps, but further debugging is needed.  

---  

### 🔄 **On issue [GitHub Issue #4636](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4636), the problem is a recursive call of `setViewReference` in `BaseVolumeViewport.ts`. If we remove the `setViewReference` call from a specific section, OHIF works correctly. The question is how necessary the specific call is and if there are any ideas how to avoid calling the function recursively there.**  
- Suggested fix: Add a check to ensure the orientation was applied before calling recursively.  
- Code snippet provided:  
  ```javascript
  if (isEqual(this.getCamera().viewPlaneNormal, refViewPlaneNormal)) {  
    setViewReference(...);  
  }
  ```  

---  

### 🧠 **For the Auto segmentation with SAM which was released earlier with Cornerstone and there is an example as well, will it be implemented on OHIF? If not, where can I get the code for the examples shown on Cornerstone?**  
- It is in the SAM ClientSide example

---  

### 🧭 **We are working with MRI images that have an oblique image plane. We would like to align the camera to the image coordinate system similar to ITK-Snap and not the standard axis like (1,0,0), (0,1,0). The question would be how to achieve this, also for images with axial, sagittal, or coronal scan guidance.**  
- Follow this issue we are trying to add it https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1308

---  

### 🎛 **Toggling segment visibility does not work in video viewport. Even pre 2.0.**  
- The transcript discusses segmentation visibility issues in video viewport.  
- It was noted that the `label map image ID` might need to reference specific frames rather than a single image.  

---  

### 🖼 **NIFTI loader - I saw some issues on GitHub about images not being rendered properly when using NIFTI loader. I got the assumption that NIFTI loader is not as robust as DICOMImageLoader. Is this assumption correct? If so, are there any known issues in handling NIFTI data? Is NIFTI data different from volume?**  
- We should add the local file loader that is in wadouri of dicomImageLoader to the nifti loader

---  

### 🎨 **Want to get some guidance on this issue that deals with `LABELMAP_EDGE_PROJECTION_BLEND`.**  
- The transcript included discussions on label maps and segmentation visibility.  
- There was debugging related to how visibility settings are applied across different viewports.
