# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-11-14

## Q & A

Attendees: 13

Discussed:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è How to fix DICOM loading errors in newer OHIF versions for studies loading correctly in older versions?
- üì± Has a responsive UI/UX prototype been released with OHIF 3.9, and what's the roadmap for responsiveness?
- üîí How to open DICOM images directly from secured dcm4chee in OHIF Viewer?
- ü§ñ Is Google's CT Foundation Model being integrated into OHIF Viewer?
- üßÆ Why is there a TMTV/segmentation volume unit discrepancy in TMTV mode?
- ü§î Why does TMTV in TMTV mode seem to be the sum of segmentations, and is there a unit conversion error?
- üîë What's the status and future of the KEOPS project and its viewer integrations?



**Questions and Summarized Answers:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **I am getting an error similar to this github issue https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/3865

This specific study is loading correctly on OHIF 3.6.0
but failing on OHIF 3.8.3 and 3.9.0-beta.81 (a newer PACS server)

The github issue seems to reference a dicom-web issue.  2 questions.  

Do you have any advice on if we can modify the data/metadata on the dicom-web side to prevent the error appearing on the OHIF side?   

Or is there any configuration on the OHIF side that we could enable?**

Answer: 
- If the study loads locally in `viewer.ohif.org/local`, the issue likely stems from DICOM web metadata, not data or decoder issues.
-  Anonymized data and an issue creation are recommended for further investigation.  Test deployments for OHIF 3.7 and 3.8 are available for debugging.
- https://viewer.ohif.org/local

üì± **It seems 3.9 is released. Congrats. Did you already release a prototype of responsive UI/UX? Or not yet?**

- The responsive UI/UX development is taking longer than initially estimated. Revamping the component library is a prerequisite for a proper responsive design.
- Most major components have been migrated to the new library. This will serve as the foundation for the responsive overhaul in subsequent releases.
- Community feedback sessions and test branches will be available, similar to the process used for new panels and components.
- A new component playground (docs.ohif.org/components) showcases the redesigned components and patterns.

üîí **Can I be able to open DICOM images directly from secured dcm4chee on ohif viewer ? 
So far I have not succeeded and need some help and pointers. Thanks**

- Yes, it's possible. Refer to the user access control documentation (docs.ohif.org) for guidance on connecting OHIF Viewer to a secure DCM4chee and Orthanc using Keycloak.
- This recipe focuses on building a secure setup from scratch.  For connecting to an existing secure DCM4chee, further customization might be needed, potentially involving modifications to DCM4chee's configuration.
- Explore the recipes in `platform/app/.recipes/`, particularly the `Nginx-Dcm4chee-Keycloak` example.
- Consider deploying OHIF separately and connecting it to your secure DCM4chee instance, rather than embedding OHIF within DCM4chee.

ü§ñ **Are there any efforts underway to integrate the CT Foundation model from Google Health/its API into the viewer in any way? Like creating a cursor-type workflow for radiologists?**

- OHIF's focus is on core use cases like segmentation, radiotherapy, performance, and customizability, not specific model integrations.
- OHIF provides APIs for writing custom extensions to integrate external services like the CT Foundation model. You can capture viewport data, call the API, and display results in a panel.
- If specific API functionalities are missing for this type of integration, OHIF developers will consider adding them.

üßÆ **In the TMTV mode, the TMTV seems to be the sum of segmentations**
(Further clarified in the transcript as a unit discrepancy between TMTV and segmentations).

- The TMTV calculation uses a factor of `1E-3` to convert the volume from cubic millimeters (based on voxel count and spacing) to milliliters.
- The reported issue of a one-to-one correspondence between cubic millimeters and milliliters in the display is a bug and will be addressed.

üîë **What is the status and roadmap for the KEOPS project, including its integration with OHIF and other viewers?**

- Keyops (keyops.online) is an open-source platform for sharing, uploading, and controlling access to medical images, integrating with viewers like OHIF and 3D Slicer.
- A new version addressing build issues has been released. An updated installation guide is in progress.
- Keyops acts as an index on existing PACS, allowing uploads, user authorization, search capabilities, albums, and comments.
- It integrates with OHIF via a dedicated Keyops mode and supports launching OHIF for specific studies.
- Slicer integration relies on URL handling; the user must have Slicer installed.
- Future plans include potential UI updates (using Vue 3), a static DICOM web integration recipe, and exploring funding and support options.  The repository might move to Radical Imaging or a standalone KEOPS foundation.
- Keyops uses OpenID Connect (with Keycloak) for authentication and authorization.
