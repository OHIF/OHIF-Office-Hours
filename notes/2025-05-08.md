## ✅ Questions and summarized answers


🌀 **CINE playback lags while stack prefetch is in progress with Cornerstone3D. Suspected memory io bottleneck between prefetch and renderer.**
- The team acknowledged that Cine playback can be noticeably impacted during stack prefetch.
  - This seems especially prominent with ultrasound images, which are uncompressed and processed in the main thread, making them slower compared to other modalities.
  - There’s a known issue with the decoding speed of ultrasound that the team hasn't fully resolved yet.
  - Using single-part responses instead of multipart-related ones could improve performance. Single-part responses avoid unnecessary multipart parsing overhead.
- Suggested workarounds include:
  - Postponing Cine playback until stack prefetch completes.
  - Offloading prefetch logic to web workers, enabling them to handle their own fetch queue and reduce main thread load.
  - Ensuring transfer syntax is included in metadata and switching to single-part responses via request parameter.
  - Avoid adding invisible viewports to prefetch; instead, use the built-in `studyPrefetcher` which handles preloading in background without viewport rendering.

⏸️ **The issue could be circumvented around if there was a pause/resume feature in the requestPoolManager. Are there any plans to introduce this feature?**
- There are no current plans to add a pause/resume feature to the requestPoolManager.
- The team advises against pausing fetches mid-way, as it may cause hang-ups if an image is requested and not already fetched.
- A viable alternative could be enhancing the `studyPrefetcher` to include pausing/resuming or managing fetch queues in web workers.
  - Web workers could manage and store prefetched images independently, reducing main thread contention.

🧠 **Looking for advice on configuring presets for low GPU 3D rendering**
- There is no CPU renderer for 3D currently; only stack rendering is supported via CPU.
- To optimize for low-end GPUs:
  - Use presets (not hanging protocols) with reduced quality settings.
  - Disable gradient opacity, lighting options like diffuse/specular, and interpolation.
  - Only keep scalar opacity and color transfer functions active.
- `sampleDistance` is the key setting affecting rendering quality and performance. Higher values reduce quality but improve speed.
  - The team mentioned sample distance is customizable within a 1–4 range, with higher values representing lower quality.

🌐 **Question also posted in slack - how are world coordinates calculated for planar imaging (XR, MG) that does not include ImagePositionPatient or row/column cosines? Are some default/fallback values used?**
- Yes, default values are used in the absence of `ImagePositionPatient` or orientation cosines.
- These defaults are pulled from the metadata provider.
- The defaults used in OHIF were derived from loading data into 3D Slicer and adopting its conventions.

♻️ **I’m still facing circular dependency issues in the cornerstone repo. Any quick help to remove those?**
- The team emphasized that Cornerstone actively checks for circular dependencies in every PR.
- Make sure you're on the latest Cornerstone version.
- Check your import paths—avoid importing full utility modules; instead, import specific files directly.
- The problem may also lie in the Webpack config. Refer to OHIF’s Webpack setup (`webpack.base.js` and `webpack.pwa.js`) to ensure consistency.
- If the issue persists, open an issue with specific dependency chains for further help.

📦 **How can non volume viewports not have getCompleteScalarDataArray on their voxel manager?**
- Non-volume viewports point to single slices, so the voxel manager handles only one frame at a time.
- Therefore, `getCompleteScalarDataArray` isn't applicable in that context.
- For non-volume viewports, use per-frame operations like iterating over frames and updating scalar data directly.

---

🎞️ **Video Viewports have performance issues when segmentations are present on each frame. This is confirmed on the cornerstone example video. I will provide a reproducible demo.**
- Confirmed: Video with per-frame segmentation leads to severe performance degradation, especially at 30fps.
- Recommendations:
  - Use RLE (Run-Length Encoding) voxel maps to drastically reduce the size and transmission overhead of segmentation data.
  - Avoid full `getCompleteScalarDataArray` usage; instead, iterate over individual frames and apply per-frame updates.
  - Offload processing to web workers and avoid fetching full 3D voxel maps.
  - A known regression might have occurred after a recent PR that changed how segmentation chunks are handled. The team acknowledged the need to fix and test video segmentation specifically.

🌍 **I'm adding zh-TW to i18n and noticed inconsistencies in file lists and entries across locales. What's the process for adding a new language?**
- Check two recent PRs for reference:
  - One added Russian language support.
  - Another added Arabic.
- These PRs serve as good templates for adding new languages like zh-TW.
