## Q & A

### Mitigation of the security concerns for the dynamic config

The proper way to handle CORS is to set the same origin.
The regex might not be safe either, if redirects happen as part of the attack.

### Segmentation Export Adapter

The original adapter was written for cornerstoneLegacy, and we need to write the new logic for the cornerstone3D. Meanwhile you can use png exports if that will help you

See

​​extensions/cornerstone/src/utils/CornerstoneViewportDownloadForm.tsx
platform/ui/src/components/ViewportDownloadForm/ViewportDownloadForm.tsx

### Authentication

You can take a look into one of our oidc configs here

platform/viewer/public/config/google.js

You can take the token and use the following code to inject it

```js
UserAuthenticationService.setServiceImplementation({
  getAuthorizationHeader: () => ({ Authorization: "Bearer " + token }),
})
```
