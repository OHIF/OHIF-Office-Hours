How to visualization Segmentation on OHIF v3

A: DICOM SEG is being added very soon, and will be available in the next release. We are doing QA testing on it now. There are certain
libraries you can use to convert your formats to DICOM SEG such as https://github.com/herrmannlab/highdicom https://qiicr.gitbook.io https://github.com/razorx89/pydicom-seg

Interaction issue with Thumbnail List

A: Dan needs to design the thumbnail panel, since right now if you have a study that
has a lot of priors, it brings a double scroll bar. We need a better design.

Idea of adding Material UI to OHIF

A: Not on the roadmap currently, but extensions can still use it if they install it.

Mobile support for OHIF v3

A: Known issue, but no funding is secured for it currently. We are happy to accept PRs for it.
