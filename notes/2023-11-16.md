## Q & A

### Q: https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/3754#issuecomment-1814443269

A: Now that the test data is there, Alireza will try to look at this and see what is going on.

### Q: I need some help on rotation of volumes in viewports. I am currently using volume actor setOrientation to attempt to rotate the volume but the rotation seems to be about an unexpected point in space.

A: [PR and Discussion](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/859). Can look at stackImageSyncCallback in OHIF for examples of how the frame of reference is modified between image stacks. This could be applied to modify the mapping from one volume to another.

### Q: When is the `cancel` method exactly fired in AnnotationTool?

A: See the example in `packages/tools/examples/cancelAnnotationDrawing/index.ts` and `packages/tools/src/store/cancelActiveManipulations.ts`.

### Q: In this demo https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/volumeslabscroll, which slices are interpolated (averaged) when I move from 1mm to 3mm? Also, how and where are the steps calculated (when we scroll with increased thickness, some slides are skipped)?

A: There seem to be bugs related to rendering small slabs likely in the LUT we will look
