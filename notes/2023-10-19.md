# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2023-10-19


## Q & A

Attendees: 12


### Q: I have already asked in the channel about htj2k adoption and wanted to get more clarity on what steps I need to take to show a quick demo to my peers since the adoption pr will take some time to get merged.

A: You can use the following two demos. We ahve a PR in progress to add HTJ2K progressive loading support very soon in Cornerstone3D

https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/779
https://chafey.github.io/openjphjs/test/browser/index.html

### Q: Facing some W/L issue for some dataset. PixelPaddingValue is not getting accommodate in the pixel manipulation.

A: Seems like the data have -2000 pixelPaddingValue, and we currently don't support that. We can add support for it in the future.

### Q: OHIF viewer is in an endless redirect loop. It gets Keycloak credentials, but never gets to the Study List. Error in console talks about null access token. What am I missing?

A: This might be useful link https://docs.ohif.org/deployment/user-account-control 

Other resources

platform/ui/src/contextProviders/UserAuthenticationProvider.tsx
extensions/default/src/DicomWebDataSource/index.js

### Q: Can we control OHIF segmentations at series-level? Can we show different segmentations on different series on grid viewports?

A: You should create different toolGroups and add segmentation too each toolGroup separately

cornerstoneTools.segmentation.state.getDefaultSegmentationStateManager()

### Q: How does one debug the karma tests in CS3D?

A: [In karma.conf.js set browsers to [â€˜Chromeâ€™]. If there are specific tests to debug, change their description to `fit`(from `it`).](https://www.cornerstonejs.org/docs/contribute/tests#running-tests-locally)

---

### Q: One more question, ðŸ˜€, How do you detect the outline of segmentation from the mask data(UInt8Array)?

A: The outline determination happens in the GPU in vtk.js Sources/Rendering/OpenGL/glsl/vtkVolumeFS.glsl

We have a converter that you can extract contours (in world coordinates) from the segmentation mask and is called `generateContourSetsFromLabelmap`
