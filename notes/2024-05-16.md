# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-05-16

## Q & A

Attendees: 16

Discussed:

Q: 🐞 **Issue with rendering volume slices using cornerstone3D.**

A: Could you provide sample code? The issue seems to be related to the targetId and getSpaincInNormalDirection.

---

Q: 🔲 **Avoiding additional empty slices being added as padding on the Axial orientation for the nifti volume loader.**

A: The issue is that your acquisition is oblique, so when you display as axial there is empty space that doesn't have data. You can provide an orientation object with view plane normal and view up. These can be a set which are rotations around the view plane normal. Longer term we should provide presets for these to make this easy - that would make it easy to start with acquisition.

We should have axialAcquisition, sagittalAcq and coronalAcq. Find the closest to the acquisition and calculate the other ones.

---

Q: 📃 **Segmentation dropdown not displaying all segmentations in OHIF 3.9.0-beta.6.**

A: This is to be fixed and added to 3.8.1.

---

Q: 🔍 **RTSTRUCT renders on scout series instead of its source series in OHIF 3.9.0-beta.2.**

A: We should remain on the stack viewport since the contour can be rendered there, then it will just render on the right viewport.

---

Q: 🔌 **Issue with hanging protocol not finding a match when unsupported series arrive first.**

A: All the metadata for the study is downloaded before starting to match for hanging protocols. The hanging protocol is 'default', which is in the extension default getHangingProtocolModule.

---

Q: 📦 **Estimate for implementing PET MIP as a rendering preset.**

A: Not a priority right now.

---

Q: 💻 **Handling implicit VR with InlineBinary overlay data in OHIF.**

A: There is an inline binary reader that can be used, but these tags shouldn't be inline binary. Seems like static wado converts if it is implicit VR, profiling happens but the DICOM tag converts to inline binary. Will fix in static dicomweb.

---

Q: 📂 **Sample data for testing split/sort of images in a series to create display sets.**

A: Will ask around for some examples on the slack channel or alternatively we can fake the seriesInstanceUIDs to be the same. Alireza thinks a UI element might be useful in the panel as well to run this.

---  

Q: 🔐 **Configuring OIDC with Google Cloud for redirection to authentication page after logout.**

A: Current behaviour is that the page is blank. We should add a default /logout page for redirecting to the login page. Try the post_redirect_uri to redirect to another viewer page to see if that renders/redirects.

Another person: post_logout_redirect_uri: '/logout-redirect' is what I have and it properly redirects to my login page. This is not google cloud though.

---

Q: 🌐 **Difference between wadoRoot and wadoUriRoot in DICOMweb configuration.**

A: wadoURIRoot is deprecated, but it can be used in JSON type viewers that use the old wado URI interface -t hat is the https:..../wado?requestType=WADO&.... request type.

---

Q: 📏 **Issue with SequenceOfUltrasoundRegions and measurements in cornerstone3D.**

A: We tried the data in OHIF and it works fine, so it seems like to be a cornerstone3D metadata problem.

---

Q: 👀 **Suggestions for white screen issue when rendering huge resolution DICOMs.**

A: I'm not really sure about the other solutions. Would help to take a look at the data when using the cpu rendering, since that should work.

---

Q: 🔍 **Usefulness of HTJ2K for rendering normal CT scans.**

A: Not really, if the server and network are fast enough, the gain is negligible for regular CT. For volume rendering (starting from MPR) sure, we can fill up the volume much faster with lower resolution.

---

Q: 🔒 **Locking annotations in legacy cornerstone-tools.**

A: You can make the annotation to be passive, so that user cannot change it.

---

Q: 🔳 **Creating MPR from stack viewport.**

A: Yes there are utilities, called convertSTackToVolumeViewport in packages/core/src/utilities/convertStackToVolumeViewport.ts.

---

Q: ⚡️ **Availability of Probe tool in Segmentation Mode.**

A: Yes it can be available, you can add it to your toolGroup and assign a button to it see here https://docs.ohif.org/platform/extensions/modules/toolbar.
