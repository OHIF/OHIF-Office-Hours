## ✅ Questions and summarized answers


🧠 **I want to ask about the tradeoffs between using setAtIJK/setAtIndex and setCompleteScalarDataArray. The latter seems to be doing the manipulations much quicker than the former.**
- Yes, `setCompleteScalarDataArray` is significantly faster than `setAtIJK` or `setAtIndex`, especially when manipulating large volumes.
  - `setAtIJK`/`setAtIndex` are intended for partial updates like brush tools or segment editing because they convert coordinates to indices first, adding overhead.
- `setCompleteScalarDataArray` is used when operations require modifying the scalar data as a whole, like:
  - Thresholding entire volumes
  - Merging label maps
  - Parametric map creation or contour-to-label map conversions
  - Interpolation operations which consume the entire label map
- There's a memory tradeoff: the complete array approach *used to* consume significantly more memory, but this is not always the case now due to sub-array optimization in the current voxel manager implementation.
- Summary: Use `setCompleteScalarDataArray` for whole-volume operations; use `setAtIndex` or `setAtIJK` for localized manipulations.

🌀 **I know this is only for 1 case submission,: Laterality issues on CT/MRI when Flip + Rotate are used—slices misalign, markers incorrect.**
- There is a known issue when both Flip and Rotate are applied—laterality markers may behave inconsistently:
  - For example, flipping horizontally and rotating introduces misalignment.
  - This was recently fixed for flips alone, but combinations still have issues.
- The behavior was confirmed: “Yes, flipping horizontal and rotating 180 is equivalent to a horizontal flip,” but problems still arise when combined with 90° rotations.
- Issue may stem from slice inversion during interactions (e.g., scroll resets orientation unexpectedly).
- Suggested resolution: Open a GitHub issue with DICOM files and reproducible steps.

🖥️ **Some of the new AI tools require specific higher GPU video cards/specs. Is there a strategy for a smooth UI experience for users who might not have the proper specs?**
- Strategy must account for varying hardware environments:
  - Models take time to load due to image encoding at scroll time; currently 1 second per image for encoding.
  - Proposals to improve UX:
    - Pre-encode nearby slices to reduce scroll-time latency.
    - Add a UI loader/indicator to reflect processing time.
- Tools like `navigator.deviceMemory` and `navigator.gpu` offer *limited or inaccurate* device info.
- Potential solution: Use external packages like `detectGPU` to classify GPU tiers and conditionally enable features.
- CPU rendering fallback is available but only for stack viewports—not for oblique MPR views.
  - Possible to expand CPU rendering for MPR with about 2 weeks of effort if resourced.
- WASM-based interpolation may optimize performance for CPU-based MPR rendering in the future.

🔄 **In MPR, laterality markers don’t update after transforms. Also, reference lines stopped working in 3.10. Where should I look in the code to fix this?**
- Laterality markers issue is likely linked to a build system problem (e.g., differences between Yarn and Bun).
  - Works correctly when built with Yarn, breaks under Bun.
- Reference lines not working in 3.10 is a regression and will be included in a future “recovery” patch focused on UI regressions.
- Suggestion: Open separate GitHub issues for both laterality and reference line bugs to ensure they're tracked.

💥 **We have related hardware spec issues with MPR mode with extensive studies with many slices, where MPR mode crashes.**
- On Windows systems with integrated + discrete GPUs, browsers sometimes default to integrated GPU, causing MPR crashes.
  - Manual user intervention (forcing Chrome to use GPU) can resolve this.
- When WebGL fails, consider switching to CPU rendering pipeline:
  - Currently only available for stack viewports (standard views).
  - Oblique views require trilinear interpolation, which isn't supported in CPU rendering yet.
- A fast CPU-based MPR viewer could be implemented using voxel manager tools within two weeks if development resources are allocated.
- WASM could help accelerate oblique rendering and interpolation in the long run.
- Crash workaround: limit open tabs and slices loaded when using MPR on low-end systems.
