# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-04-18

## Q & A  

Attendees: 12  

Discussed:

Q: 🔧 **Adding a standalone toggleable button on the main toolbar in OHIF.**  

A: The uiType only affects the appearance. To modify the behaviour, you need to add behaviour to determine the toggle setting. You also need to reference it in the createButtonSection after creating the button. The evaluate will determine the toggle state, and apply the view. There is also a system toggle like cine tool that applies across the app. Create your own custom evaluator that

Q: 🚫 **MPR hanging protocol not working after dragging another series into the viewport.**

A: We have fixed a lot of issues, just wait a couple of days for 3.8 and everything would be much better.

---

Q: **Usage of ImageOverlayTool to show heatmaps over the image.**

A: What is the heatmap? It is an array of image coordinates. In the next version parametric maps (contour maps) will be added that can be used instead. You need to parse the dicom parametric map and create a volume viewport and overlay that, the tmtv is something similar since the PT series are float (similar to probabilities), you need to just implement the getSopClassHandler for the dicom parametric map and then force it to open in volume viewport of the referenced series, then you can add colors etc and color bar.

Q: 🚧 **Tracking loading progress for images in OHIF.**

A: https://viewer-v2-legacy.ohif.org/pwa/viewer/1.3.6.1.4.1.25403.345050719074.3824.20170125095438.5 had loading indicators. This will get added in the next version as a UI enhancement/indicator. It won't track which images have been displayed. You can also take a look at Image volume modified and add numFrames, framesProcessed in the call in BaseStreamingImageVolume and show the progress report in a div and update it with an event listener.

Q: 📥 **Issue with downloading original DICOM SEG series through OHIF.**  

A: This is downloading the currently displayed data, which is a new segmentation. Probably we should have an isDirty flag to download the original data instead. (when not dirty). For the missing tags, probably this should be added to the new data. Inside the commands module generate segmentation, the segment metadata should grab the segmentation display set and check if it is dirty, and if not, then include the missing tags from segMetadata. In CS3D getSegmentMetadata (adapters), look at the seriesUID getting generated and allow that to be updated.

Q: 🔳 **Incorrect TMTV slice sync between PET and CT in Sagittal and Coronal views.**

A: Could you reproduce in Cornerstone with 4 viewports and the syncing applied. The synchronizer is quite simple just has a source and target camera and just sets it. We will take a look as well.

---

Q: 🖼️ **Customizing thumbnails in OHIF to display instances instead of series.**  

A: You need a custom sop class handler that splits the instances into multiple instance. Then, create one display set for every image or whatever your grouping is.

---

Q: ✂️ **Activating and deactivating tools in OHIF.**

A: You can take a look at evaluators https://docs.ohif.org/platform/extensions/modules/toolbar#evaluators We have modified the toolbar a lot.

---  

Q: 🚫 **Disabling/hiding the OHIF menu on measurement.**

A: Maybe just return here?

function initContextMenu({
 cornerstoneViewportService,
 customizationService,
 commandsManager,
}): void {

---

Q: ⌛ **Performance differences between fetching Dicom metadata from storage vs database.**  

A: The study initially clicked on in the OHIF study list is the only study which is immediately loaded. The number of metadata fetches should be one per series in the study clicked on. There is also a setting that will start displaying once a specified number of studies has been loaded. The remaining series metadata requests will also be requested after the first set is done.

See static dicomweb for an efficient implementation of dicomweb - using the same type of implementation in postgres will result in fast access through postgres.

---

Q: 📐 **Displaying annotations on multiple images with same Study & Series UID.**

A: This might be the annotation metadata is wrong, does it have the referencedImageId in it? If not, check the handles in world coordinates, and see if they are placed in the correct location. You can drag and drop the image in the 3D slicer and see the world coordinates in the bottom left in the world and check if they are correct.

--- 

Q: 📺 **Monitor calibration support for grayscale standard display function (GSDF) in OHIF.**

A: Usually the monitor calibration is embedded in the actual display so that the grayscale function displayed in the browser is directly the grayscale standard.

---

Q: 🔲 **Using acquired DICOM series in different modes instead of reconstruction.**  

A: This could be done with a different hanging protocol that you could use to display this. As long as the volumes are correct with the same frame of reference, they should be synchronizable.

---

Q: 🔐 **Integrating OHIF viewer with Google Healthcare without password.**

A: Take a look at the google healthcare section of the deployment guide. Add a service to your backend and authenticate that with google healthcare api (client) and then authenticate your user in your backend. That should get credentials from Google using fixed user id/password server side, and then create the iframe with the URL having the right type of keys.

---

Q: 🔘 **DICOM transfer syntax and image compression in OHIF demo site.**

A: It is compressed before, using static wado library which uses other utils https://github.com/RadicalImaging/Static-DICOMWeb

---

Q: 👀 **Best place to ask for reviewing a PR in OHIF.**

A: Done
