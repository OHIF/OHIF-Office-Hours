## Q & A

Attendees: 13


---
**Q: How can I show segmentations coming from hidicom using cs3d and ohif?. Any tutorial on this will be very helpful.**

A: If you're working with the latest versions of CS3D and OHIF, displaying segmentations shouldn't be a problem. CS3D now supports overlapping segments,  and OHIF can read full part 10  files. Look into `getSopClassHandlerModule.js` within the `cornerstone-dicom-seg` extension for relevant code.  

---
**Q: Interested in a brief rundown of how SEG instances are loaded via wado-rs**

A: SEG instances are retrieved via wado-rs as full part 10 files (using the "application/dicom" content type). Consider storing received  files directly, rather than splitting them into individual frames, to simplify handling. Note that  there are experimental DICOM options for compressed per-frame storage and multi-segment indexes. 

---
**Q: When building our application (React viewer built based on CornerstoneJS) using vite, we’ve encountered build errors caused by circular dependencies in CornerstoneJS. When building using webpack, these issues are not present. Have you encountered this issue?**

A: Yes, this is a known issue being addressed. The problem stems from directly importing classes instead of 'type'. Some fixes will require breaking changes due to inter-class dependencies  (especially within the DICOM image loader). See related pull request: https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/798

--- 
**Q: I’m working on improving the abandoned PR https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/534. I’m curious if it’s okay if I open the new PR? I’ll definitely mention the original one.**

A: Yes! Please open a new pull request and add co-authors who contributed to the original PR. 

---
**Q: I would like to demo this bug, and get some guidance on fixing it. https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/3909**

A: After an upcoming merge, the team can take a closer look. The provided test data will be helpful. (**Note:** A more detailed description of the bug would be ideal if possible).

--- 
**Q: How to create a Cine-player-like slider and input box in OHIF viewer's toolbar? Can we use ToolbarService or CineService?**

A: It's not clear whether ToolbarService or CineService would be the ideal approach without more context on the desired functionality. Consider providing additional details or a mockup. In addition you can setup a new layout inside the layout module 
to add a new toolbar component.

---
**Q: In tmtv extension, getHangingProtocolModule.js defined 4 stages (stage1...4). From both developer's and user's perspective, how these stages are used (switched)?**

A:  **Users:** Switch stages using the ',' and '.' keys (on US keyboards). **Developers:**  Call the `setHangingProtocol` command with appropriate arguments. Keyboard shortcut details can be found here:  commandName: 'nextStage', label: 'Next Stage', keys: ['.']. 

---
**Q: In tmtv extenion, utils\hpViewports.ts defined several syncGroups - Would you please explain: a) What do the values of "source" and "target" mean here? b) What are the enumeration of "type" values?**

A: a) In viewport synchronization: 
   * **source:**  Changes on this viewport trigger events for other viewports to navigate accordingly.
   * **target:**  This viewport changes in response to changes on other viewports.

b)  'type' values are defined by registered synchronizers (see SyncGroupService for default sets). Options provide finer control over synchronization behavior. The 'id' field allows distinct sync groups.

---
**Q: When seg is encoded as ‘binary’, it’s one bit per pixel right? In dicomimageloader, in the file ‘unpackBinaryFrame’ it converts to one byte per pixel - why? 8x memory usage right?**

A:  Yes, that increases memory usage. The conversion simplifies checking whether a pixel is included in the segmentation. To address this, a proxy instance should be added to create a  view of the raw encoding. Consider  the new RLEVoxelMap class, which offers more memory-efficient representation for overlays.

---
**Q: Could you please recommend some resource(s)/matherials regarding the 3D rendering which is used. This can help understand better the mechanics and lights and etc used in the OHIF and Cornerstone3D.**

A: Explore vtk and vtkjs, along with their documentation (e.g., the vtk user guide): https://vtk.org/documentation/
