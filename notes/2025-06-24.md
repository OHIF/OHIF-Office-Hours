üíª **How can I check the multi monitor feature? Or not working yet?**
- To enable multi-monitor functionality, you need to add the following to your `default.js` config file:
```js
  customizationService: ['@ohif/extension-default.customizationModule.multimonitor']
````

* You also need to configure your browser to allow opening up additional windows automatically, as multi-monitor usage requires the browser to launch new windows.
* This can be tested by appending `?multiMonitor=true` or similar parameters to your app URL, as documented.
* It‚Äôs possible that the feature is broken; a new issue has been created to track this: [GitHub issue #5141](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/5141)

üîó **just some feedback on website that‚Äôs not been addressed in the forum**

* Several broken links were reported on the OHIF website, particularly under the `modes` documentation section.
* The ECG Viewer link is currently private or outdated, even though it was intended as a demo project. Its GitHub repo is no longer accessible.
* Alternatives:

  * OHIF still has some ECG rendering capabilities and historical code under: [Radical Imaging ECG Mode GitHub](https://github.com/RadicalImaging/OHIFExtensionsAndModes/tree/main/ohif-configurable/ecg-dicom)
  * A new contribution to [Cornerstone3D issue #2140](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/2140) includes new ECG tools that could be ported.
* Contributors are encouraged to integrate such tools into Cornerstone, not OHIF, to support broader compatibility and synchronization features (e.g., ECG-video sync).
* There's a guide for migrating old Cornerstone code into Cornerstone 3D:

  * [https://docs.cornerstonejs.org/migration-guides/](https://docs.cornerstonejs.org/migration-guides/)

üßä **I found a issue in several dicom when trying to recompute SUV values, there is an uncaught error on image decaching**

* The issue is reproducible with some DICOMs and occurs during recomputation of SUV values or SEG loading.
* Root cause: the decaching mechanism attempts to remove an image that's part of a view, triggering an error because Cornerstone 3D‚Äôs volume model doesn‚Äôt allow this by default.
* Suggested fix:

  * Use `force: true` when removing the image from cache, specifically when reloading metadata:

    ```js
    cache.removeImage(imageId, { force: true })
    ```
  * This is considered safe in this specific context because the image will be reloaded immediately after.
* Other problems:

  * SEG loading can also crash the viewport (black screen, freezes) due to similar volume handling logic.
  * Shader errors may occur (`Error compiling shader '#version 300 es`)‚Äîthis is being investigated.
* Related PR: [OHIF PR #5139](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/5139)
* Open issues:

  * [OHIF issue #5126](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/5126)
  * [OHIF issue #5147](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/5147)

‚úèÔ∏è **How can I build a custom annotation tool? Right now, I‚Äôm having issues with the rendering part (or it works very buggy) and can‚Äôt seem to get it to work. Where can I find an example? Also, is there a list of experts who can help with this (paid)?**

* Common problem: SVG layer and viewport layer dimensions don‚Äôt match, causing rendering bugs.

  * Fix: call `renderingEngine.resize()` after a short timeout:

    ```js
    setTimeout(() => renderingEngine.resize(), 1000)
    ```
* Verify that SVG overlay dimensions (width, height) match those of the canvas.
* Use examples from:

  * `packages/tools/examples/stackAnnotationTools/index.ts`
  * [https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/resize.html](https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/resize.html)
* If overlapping annotations don‚Äôt work (e.g., redrawing at same point):

  * Override the proximity check logic in `isPointNearTool` to always return `false`.
* For paid help:

  * Submit request at [https://www.ohif.org/support](https://www.ohif.org/support)
  * Support may be provided through MGH or Radical Imaging based on scope.

üõ†Ô∏è **At my company, we are building a radiology application based on OHIF. We are currently in the process of upgrading from version 3.6 to 3.7, and we are running into some challenges. For instance, we noticed that viewportIndex has been deprecated in favor of viewportId, and the viewports array has been replaced with a Map, which requires corresponding updates across our codebase. In addition, we occasionally need to customize parts of OHIF itself to meet specific requirements, which further complicates the upgrade process. Given these challenges, what would you recommend as a best practice strategy for: Customizing or extending OHIF in a maintainable way? Minimizing friction and technical debt during version upgrades? Needless to say that we are already using mode and extensions. Thanks in advance for your insights!**

* Migration from 3.6 to 3.7 was significant and painful for many users; unfortunately, no official migration guide exists for 3.6 ‚Üí 3.7.
* Recommendation:

  * Encapsulate your logic in **modes and extensions** as much as possible.
  * Use a **command module layer** to isolate calls to `servicesManager` or other internal OHIF APIs. This makes upgrades easier if internals change.
  * Refer to: [OHIF PR #3591](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/3591)
* Migration guides do exist for other versions (e.g., 3.7 ‚Üí 3.8), and you can check related PRs for hints.
* The UI layer is under active change, so expect continued evolution over the next year.
* Customization points are being expanded, but not all use cases are covered yet.

üì° **Regarding progressive loading of images, what are your thoughts? What I would like to do at some point is implement a feature where in a low bandwidth environment, I can set the viewer to only load to a particular resolution.**

* Use Cornerstone 3D‚Äôs existing **progressive loader** with HTJ2K.

  * You can remove later progressive stages to cap the resolution.
  * See example: `cornerstone3D/examples/progressiveLoadVolume`
* For stack loading (e.g., X-ray), same principle applies‚Äîdelete unused stages.
* Use **byte-range loading** instead of full streaming to limit how much data is fetched.
* Streaming loading doesn‚Äôt support partial fetch well (e.g., canceling fetch mid-way is problematic).
* Alternative: Convert data to **NIfTI** format at lower resolution, which tends to be smaller and easier to handle in low-bandwidth settings.

  * A NIfTI loader is under development and will be open source.
* Lossy image display indicators:

  * Cornerstone 3D stores lossy status metadata, but doesn‚Äôt yet display overlays for that.
  * You can build your own overlays using new top-left/top-right display slots.
