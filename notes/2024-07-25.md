# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-07-25

## Q & A

Attendees: 21

Discussed:

üñ•Ô∏è **I'm trying to understand the different strategies for rendering as some volumes looks very different on different devices - reference for example https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1402**

A: The issue appears to be related to how different devices handle float textures. iPhones do not have float texture rendering support, so probability maps and certain modalities like PET with SUV correction may render incorrectly. Some potential solutions:
- Use the `useNorm16Texture` flag to use 16-bit integers instead of floats
- Try the `preferSizeOverAccuracy` flag 
- Scale values to a larger integer range (e.g. 0-1000 instead of 0-1)
- For PET images, be aware that attenuation corrected (AC) images may render oddly on iPhone

üñåÔ∏è **Trying to understand how to use the Segmentation functionality in the OHIF segmentation viewer to load and display bitmasks. Currently upon the brush tool being clicked I register/load a web image via this loader and display it via loadImageToCanvas from cornerstone utils. But this does not persist (goes away when scrolling through volume) and it is not a bitmask.**

A: For creating and displaying segmentations in OHIF:

1. Use a tool like HiDICOM to export your segmentations (e.g. from PyTorch) as DICOM Segmentation objects. 
2. HiDICOM allows converting NumPy arrays to DICOM SEG format.
3. OHIF has native support for displaying DICOM SEG objects.
4. For uploading/storing:
   - You can use drag-and-drop functionality in OHIF for local files
   - For server storage, look into open-source PACS systems like DCM4CHEE or Orthanc
   - Google Cloud Healthcare API is also supported

Check the OHIF documentation for deployment recipes and configuration details for different backend options.

üîÑ **Is it possible to 'loadAndCacheImage' DICOM images in the background using Cornerstone3D? According to the documentation, a Viewport is required, which necessitates providing an HTMLDivElement. Is there a way to bypass this requirement and still cache the image before it display on the screen?**

A: Yes, it is possible to pre-cache images without a viewport. You can use the recently merged PR for prefetching:

this.imageLoadPoolManager.addRequest(
  async () =>
    this.imageLoader.loadAndCacheImage(imageId, options).then(
      _image => this._onImagePrefetchSuccess(imageRequest),
      error => this._onImagePrefetchFailed(imageRequest, error)
    ),
  this.requestType,
  { imageId }
);

This approach uses a request pool manager and doesn't require a viewport. The documentation might be outdated on this point.

üîÜ **I have raised issue on office hours (4th July) about Window Level/width whenever using compressed image, follow up to that, i have raised issue on Github as well to further look into same but have not received response, is it possible to take look into same. Here is link to github - https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1373**

A: The issue appears to be related to changes in metadata after compression, specifically the rescale slope and intercept values. To troubleshoot:

1. Compare the metadata of the original and compressed images using a tool like the DICOM metadata dump viewer.
2. Check if the `RescaleSlope` and `RescaleIntercept` values are different in the compressed version.
3. Try removing these values from the metadata and let Cornerstone calculate based on min/max pixel values.
4. For custom window presets (like brain or bone), be aware that these force specific values and may not adapt to the new pixel data range.

Test these changes and update the GitHub issue with your findings.

üßä **Regarding 3D rendering of label map segmentation, will it be included in 3.9 release? Or is there any blocker for that?**

A: Yes, 3D rendering of label map segmentations is planned for inclusion in the 3.9 release. The bulk of the work has been done, and it should be available in the upcoming version. You can see an example of this functionality in the polyseg WASM volume labelmap to surface example in the Cornerstone documentation.

‚û°Ô∏è **Currently, arrow measurement saves only one tip (the point to the end). Is it easily feasible to save the other tip as well, like length measurement? Because of this, users cannot expect to load arrow as they saved before. Arrow rotates randomly.**

A: This issue is likely related to how arrow annotations are stored and restored. There are two areas to investigate:

1. In the adapters/Cornerstone3D/ArrowAnnotate.js file, check how the annotation is converted to and from the TID (Template ID) representation.

2. In the ArrowAnnotateTool configuration, look at the `arrowFirst` property. This might need to be set to false to correctly store both ends of the arrow.

Additionally, arrow annotations are not standard in DICOM SR, so they are likely represented as a composite of other elements. Review these areas and consider updating the storage method to include both arrow tips.

üìä **What are the timelines regarding GSPS support and do you have any logistical issues for implementing this. Such as known issues or any hurdles I might encounter along the way if I were to implement this.**

A: OHIF is actively working on partial GSPS (Grayscale Softcopy Presentation State) support. There are a few aspects to consider:

1. View stuff: How to handle display area, pan, zoom, etc.
2. Annotation stuff: How to represent various annotations in GSPS format.
3. Rendering: How to display these annotations in the viewer.

There was a previous PR for OHIF v2 that wasn't merged, but it provides a starting point. The current tooling system has changed, so some adaptation will be needed. 

For implementation:
- Annotations should go through the DICOM SR display tool
- Presentations should use the setViewPresentation method

If you're interested in contributing, the OHIF team can provide guidance, but the expectation is that the work would be contributed back to the open-source project.

üìÑ **Hello everyone. My team would like to know whether standard reporting (with different reporting standards) will be added and where it lies in the roadmap. This references the final reports sent out to doctors for diagnosis.**

A: OHIF currently supports DICOM PDF for report viewing. For generating reports:

1. You can create panels within OHIF for doctors to fill in necessary information.
2. Your backend can then create a DICOM PDF using tools like DCM4CHEE's toolkit.
3. OHIF already has support for displaying these DICOM PDFs.

For more advanced reporting features:
1. Provide more details about your specific reporting standards and requirements.
2. Consider posting a detailed request in the OHIF Slack channel for further discussion.
3. Depending on your needs, you might need to develop custom extensions or integrate with external reporting systems.

üîÅ **Any reason to call applyHangingProtocol twice? Can we get rid of anyone?**

A: The double call to `applyHangingProtocol` is likely related to handling studies with many series efficiently. The reasons might include:

1. Initial quick display: Apply hanging protocol with a subset of series (e.g., 10%) to show something quickly.
2. Full application: Apply again after all metadata is loaded to ensure the best match.

This is related to the `hpInitiationCriteria` setting, which allows specifying a minimum number of series needed to run the hanging protocol initially. For studies with fewer series, this double call might not be necessary, but it ensures proper handling of large studies without long initial load times.

üñ•Ô∏è **Hello everyone, thank you for the session. I would love to know what are the best server specs to host the viewer on a cloud provider**

A: The optimal server specifications depend on your specific use case, including factors like:

1. Number of users
2. Size and complexity of studies
3. Expected concurrent usage

As a starting point:
- 8 to 16 GB of RAM
- Good bandwidth
- Monitor CPU utilization and adjust as needed

Start with a moderate setup and scale based on actual usage and performance metrics. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, as requirements can vary greatly depending on the specific deployment scenario.

üîê **On authentication, I tried using keycloak, it works, so would want to request if there is a way we can enhance authorization (like a person can access images from his/her group). Is there a work around for this?**

A: For group-based access control with Keycloak:

1. Set up groups in Keycloak for different access levels (e.g., center1, center2).
2. Modify the Nginx configuration to use the auth_request module.
3. Implement a backend service that:
   - Communicates with Keycloak to get user group information
   - Queries a database to determine study access based on group
   - Responds with 200 (allow) or 400 (deny) to Nginx

This setup requires:
1. Modifying Nginx config to point to your custom backend instead of auth2_proxy
2. Implementing a backend service (e.g., Express.js) to handle authorization logic
3. Setting up a database to store study-group access mappings

This is an advanced use case that requires custom development beyond OHIF's core functionality.

üîó **Hi everyone, before trying to integrate OHIF in my React app (maybe using an iframe) I would like to understand how I could transfer data between the iframe and the rest of my app?**

A: To communicate between an iframe containing OHIF and your parent React app:

1. Use standard web techniques for iframe-parent communication (e.g., postMessage).
2. For updating measurements:
   - Access the annotation state in OHIF: `cornerstoneTools.annotation.state.getAllAnnotations()`
   - Find and edit the specific annotation
   - Call render to update the view
3. To display measurements outside OHIF:
   - Set up a message listener in your parent app
   - Have OHIF send measurement data via postMessage when changes occur
   - Update your React state with the received data

üîí **I have setup a dcm4chee secure PACS server, with keycloak. I am trying to connect ohif to the same, but getting auth errors. Have tried the config and realm from recently added recipe too.**

A: After investigating the issue with Pragya, it was found that the client authentication needs to be set to "off" inside the Keycloak admin panel. This is because OHIF with OIDC is only a public client and doesn't have a server component. Making this change should resolve the authentication errors.

---

üè• **Also, I want to know if any adaptation of OHIF is FDA approved.**

A: While OHIF itself is not FDA approved, there is a commercial adaptation that has received FDA approval. FlexView (https://flexview.ai/) is a product based on OHIF that has additional functionalities, particularly around cloud integrations, and has gone through the FDA approval process.

üîÑ **Progressive loading in CS 3D: i am trying to run the progressive loading on the CS 3D stack viewport, so far, i have used Static-wado webserver and have convered DICOM p10 files to DICOM web format with tool given by Static-wado package itself, now, i am trying to HTJ2k retrieval configuration with streaming:true, i am unable to do it. How can i configure Static-wado web-server to use streaming/byte-range? Also, is it possible to use another server than Static-wado server with streaming like Express.js or AWS Cloudfront?**

A: This is a complex question that requires more in-depth discussion. It's recommended that you join the next office hours session where Bill can provide more detailed assistance with this issue. Progressive loading, especially with HTJ2K and streaming configurations, can be intricate and may require specific setup steps that are best explained in a live session.
