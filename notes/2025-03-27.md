## ✅ Questions and summarized answers

📱 **Hello, I'm currently working on a medical image viewer application using the latest version of Cornerstone.js. I've encountered performance issues specifically related to slab thickness adjustments when visualizing volume data using orthographic viewports on mobile devices. [...] Could you please provide insights on: Possible reasons why newer, more powerful devices (like the iPhone 15 Pro) might experience significant lag compared to older devices? Recommendations or best practices for optimizing slab thickness rendering performance on mobile devices with Cornerstone.js? Any known compatibility issues or specific configurations that might improve performance in this scenario?**
- This issue appears to be tied to recent iOS regressions. iOS 18 introduced a regression that impacts rendering performance. Apple has acknowledged it and is reportedly working on a fix.
  - See: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/771450?answerId=827770022
- Other Android devices may also experience regressions, though iOS 15 Pro seems particularly problematic despite its higher power.
- Differences in performance between similar iOS versions across devices (e.g., iPhone 11 vs. iPhone 15 Pro) likely relate to internal hardware or WebKit rendering changes.
- The issue becomes more noticeable when increasing slab thickness, as this requires more computation.
- Suggested steps:
  - Use `debug.ohif.org` to analyze device capabilities (e.g., `float-linear` support).
  - Compare against known benchmarks like `vtk.js` examples with slab thickness.
  - Report discrepancies to WebKit/Apple developer forums for more visibility and potential fixes.
- This is a complex, browser-level performance issue not fully within Cornerstone's control.
- GitHub issue for reference: https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1947

🖊️ **Annotations are not tied to viewportIds rather to frameOfReference and referencedImageIds. Why is that?**
- Frame of Reference-based annotations allow consistent positioning across synchronized views (e.g., same lesion shown in axial/sagittal views).
- Reference Image ID is used when you want annotations to appear only on one image (like in stack viewports).
- When creating annotations, use `annotationState.addAnnotation` and specify the group (element or frame of reference).
- If both frameOfReference and referencedImageId are populated, it depends on how it was added to the annotation state—not just metadata.
- Default behavior:
  - Volume viewport → uses frame of reference.
  - Stack viewport → uses image ID.
- Future improvements may include multiple annotation managers to handle more complex use cases (like comparing current vs. prior scans).

🔔 **I’d like to use my own toast component. However, the NotificationProvider is importing the Toaster from ui-next, and the ErrorBoundary is importing the toast directly from ‘sonner’. How would you recommend I customize these?**
- Suggested refactor: treat the toast component similarly to how `ModalProvider` is used.
  - Accept components via props so custom implementations can be passed in.
- This would allow decoupling the default toaster and replacing it with your own.
- You’re welcome to submit a PR with this improvement.

🧩 **I am trying to load a labelmap on a MIP using a volume3D viewport. The labelmap is showing on every volume viewport but not on the MIP.**
- The issue was previously fixed in a recent PR.
- Make sure you’re using the `dev` branch and that TMTV mode is enabled.
- Works correctly in the latest Cornerstone dev mode.
- Try using the example shown in the `LabelmapMIP` demo and ensure correct version is used.

📱 **I have a two questions on OHIF related to Mobile compatibility and small screen size: 1. Does OHIF provide a plugin or package to use in Mobile devices? I am looking to use it in the Flutter application. 2. I see OHIF does not look good in small screen sizes especially top bars with controls. They are overlapping. Is there any setting or config available to handle this?**
- No separate plugin/package for mobile or Flutter support due to resource limitations.
- Plan is to make OHIF layouts responsive for Progressive Web App (PWA) use.
- Current work is underway to improve responsive design (e.g., responsive grid layouts).
- Older OHIF versions lacked responsiveness—improvements are actively being developed.

🚀 **What can I consider to change if I want to improve the initial loading time of Ohif? If internet connection is so fast (~1G) and enough system memory (~32GB)?**
- Play with `maxNumberOfRequests` config in the Cornerstone init:
  - Controls how many requests of each type (e.g., interaction, thumbnail, prefetch, compute) are allowed.
  - Example: `{ interaction: 10, thumbnail: 5, prefetch: 5, compute: 10 }`
- Trade-offs:
  - Too many prefetch requests can block interaction-related bandwidth.
- Increase number of web workers for decoding:
  - Use max available CPUs via `maxWebWorkers`.
  - Each compute-heavy task (e.g., segmentation) can use dedicated workers.
- Web workers and network bandwidth both matter for performance—optimize both.

🧪 **Starting point for DICOM-LabelMap? Maybe somewhere in cornerstone3D? Can the below one be sample data? https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/viewer?StudyInstanceUIDs=61.7.93273854116647800470730671671118421206**
- That dataset is large (~400 MB) and a good candidate for benchmarking.
- Could be used as part of a sample dataset collection.
- Code-wise, labelmap-related logic is handled in `segmentation4x`.
- Overlapping segment rendering recently added.
- Saving functionality (e.g., exporting) may need pipeline updates.
- Discussions ongoing to support overlapping segmentation creation and editing in the future.

📈 **Are there maximums for maxNumRequests?**
- No hardcoded limit, but large values can cause performance issues.
- If you set prefetch to a very high number (e.g., 50,000), the viewer may saturate network and degrade UI performance.
- Recommendations depend on your use case:
  - For single series with 70–300 frames (e.g., echo studies), feel free to use large values.
  - For multiple series or heavy interactions, tune values to allow bandwidth prioritization.
