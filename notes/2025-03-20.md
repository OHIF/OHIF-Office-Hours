### 📌 Questions and Summarized Answers

---

🔄 **Want to discuss this PR that allows undo/redo on annotations. Follow-up: I checked the changes. If you delete the annotation using delete and then hit undo, it does not add it back.**  
- A PR for undo/redo on annotations was merged recently.
- It supports undoing movements, deletions, and segmentations.
- If a deleted annotation does not return on undo, it is likely a bug.
- Further investigation is needed to verify the correct behavior of undo/redo.

🔍 **Zoom change behavior between stack and volume: [Slack discussion](https://cornerstonejs.slack.com/archives/C03T99K0RA7/p1741920421471829)**  
- The zoom level appears unchanged (1.0), but visually it shifts when switching between stack and volume viewports.
- This inconsistency does not occur in all series.
- The root cause might be different zoom calculations for stack and volume viewports.
- Parallel scale is used to calculate zoom levels, and it seems to be computed differently for stack and volume.
- Further debugging is required to fully understand and resolve the issue.

---

🎨 **Can segmentation styles be different for different viewports?**  
- Yes, segmentation styles are designed to be customizable per viewport.
- Different layers of settings exist:
  - Global settings for all viewports and segmentations.
  - Segmentation-specific styles (e.g., segment 1 is always red).
  - Viewport-specific styles (e.g., viewport 1 shows segment 1 in one way, viewport 2 in another).
  - Additional customization for label maps and contours.

---

📌 **Can orientationMarker widget be positioned absolutely?**  
- Currently, the orientation marker does not support absolute positioning.
- It is possible to style the cube, but exact positioning within the viewport is not configurable.
- A workaround may involve modifying `vtk.js` settings.
- It is suggested to ask in the `vtk.js` forum for potential solutions.

---

🚀 **When is the study prefetcher expected to be enabled?**  
- There is no fixed timeline for enabling the study prefetcher.
- It depends on use cases and whether enabling it makes sense for the workflow.
- One reason for it being disabled by default is to avoid unnecessary network requests.

---

⚡ **Is there a way to give a prioritization order to extensions/modes customizations?**  
- Yes, prioritization is possible by registering extensions as named customizations rather than defaults.
- Instead of registering multiple extensions as defaults, list them explicitly in the mode startup.
- The order in which they are listed determines which customization takes priority.

---

📏 **How can I configure the grid size in the local viewer (e.g., 2 x 8)?**  
- Multiple approaches exist:
  1. **Using Hanging Protocols**: Apply `@ohif/mngrid` hanging protocol for grid layout configuration.
  2. **Custom Mode Configuration**: Define a mode (e.g., "ultrasound review mode") and specify grid settings.
  3. **Directly Modify Layout Selector**: Manually add a 2x8 preset to the layout selector customization.
- Hanging protocols do not work with local drag-and-drop mode but can be configured in a dedicated OHIF mode.

🎥 **I have 60 ultrasound clips per patient x 80 patients to review and reorder using the local viewer for data cleaning. Any pointers for a script to manually reorder clips?**  
- OHIF currently does **not** support visual drag-and-drop reordering of clips.
- A potential workaround is to use metadata-based sorting within hanging protocols.
- Implementing custom drag-and-drop functionality would require integrating a UI framework like **React Mosaic**.
- A separate discussion with the OHIF team could be scheduled for exploring development priorities.

---

🗂️ **I have a datasource, trying to manually recreate the data required from a sample study ([Study Link](https://viewer.ohif.org/viewer?StudyInstanceUIDs=2.25.317377619501274872606137091638706705333)). The study displays a PDF, but I don’t understand why a final request occurs after the PDF request.**  
- The final request is likely a metadata fetch to verify patient details.
- If local data lacks this metadata, OHIF might be making an extra request.
- Debugging suggestion: Inspect network requests to identify what additional data is being fetched.

---

🏷️ **You can add a label to the length tool, but it does not render the label.**  
- This may be an inconsistency in annotation versus measurement handling.
- Labels appear in bidirectional tools but not in lens tools.
- The issue requires further debugging to check where the text rendering logic differs.

---

📐 **General guidelines for viewport customization for system integrators (e.g., removing the zoom button).**  
- Modifications can be done via the `index.ts` file in the mode settings.
- System integrators can remove zoom via:
  - Directly modifying the mode’s toolbar configuration.
  - Using OHIF's customization service (`setCustomizations`).
- Future versions (OHIF 3.10) aim to provide easier configuration via app config files.

---

🖥️ **Is there a server-side system that integrates with OHIF for processing DICOMs (e.g., ML-based processing) and storing results in an accessible format? If none exists, is there value in an open-source backend for this?**  
- **Existing solutions:**
  - `MONAI` by NVIDIA supports ML-based DICOM processing.
  - `MONAI Label` integrates with OHIF for segmentations.
  - `MONAI Deploy` is an upcoming solution that might provide further integration.
- **Open-source backend feasibility:**
  - OHIF does **not** develop server-side solutions but provides integration points.
  - A generic backend for ML/DICOM processing would be valuable.
  - `Tesseract-MI` is an existing example of an open-source OHIF-compatible backend.

---

🔄 **Do we have any further update on DICOMWeb to Part 10 conversion?**  
- No major updates yet.
- The priority is currently on supporting **JPEG XL** and other improvements to the DICOMWeb server.
- Potential integration with AWS BUN SDK for optimized uploads is being explored.
