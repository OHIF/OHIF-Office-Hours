# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-11-21

## Q & A

Attendees: 17

Discussed:
- 🛠️ Rendering issues vary by device and depend on WebGL/browser compatibility.
- 🛠️ Follow-up needed for Issue #4348 with detailed reproduction steps.
- 🔄 Resampling resolves irregular DICOM spacing; sorting should use spatial metadata, not instance numbers.
- 🖥️ Multi-monitor support is in progress but low-priority; PR available for testing.
- 📐 Cornerstone3D exposes rotation utilities via glMatrix; transformations depend on destination-first interpolation.
- 🔄 Camera orientation differs from data transformations; use ITK-VASM for voxel-level rotation and resampling.
- 🦋 Firefox rendering differences may relate to CORS or network errors; test with anonymized datasets.
- ⚙️ Increasing max workers beyond 4 provides diminishing returns; use progressive loading for better performance.
- 📦 Migration guides cover segmentation updates; compress data locally before cloud uploads for efficiency.
- 🫀 Custom crop tools require viewport extensions; follow DICOM SR viewport examples for integration.
- 🔲 Programmatic bounding boxes can use DICOM SR annotations for persistence during zoom/pan.
- 📋 Volume imageId sorting uses spatial metadata; discrepancies may arise with feet-first datasets.


**Questions and Summarized Answers:**

🔧 **Some reports rendering issues on some mobile devices, such as Samsung phones. [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4286). But when I checked, that’s not true for all Samsung phones (tested on A35). Do you know any other typical issues which are device-specific, rather than browser, or OS? What is the current environment requirement?**
- Rendering is highly device-specific and dependent on factors like WebGL extensions and OS/browser implementation.
- Issues arise due to variability in WebGL support, especially on Android devices with different GPUs.
- For complex views like MPR (Multi-Planar Reconstruction), resource limitations can cause issues.
- A consistent test environment is recommended (e.g., Android 14, iOS latest).
- WebGPU might standardize rendering in the future.

🐞 **The issue with [GitHub Issue 4348](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4348) remains - do you need more information?**
- Reproducing the issue remains inconsistent due to potential race conditions.
- The development team suggests adding more details or reproducing steps to help debug the problem.

---

📏 **Some DICOMs have issues and we cannot expect all DICOM files to fulfill the requirements. I saw warnings next to the images (irregular spacing, 3D rendering not supported, etc.) in current OHIF. Do you think resampling can mitigate this issue? Invalid DICOM files?**
- The files are not invalid; issues arise from inconsistent spacing that the library cannot handle effectively.
- Resampling can resolve this. Use trilinear interpolation or nearest-neighbor approaches.
  - Example: Decide on spacing (e.g., slices at 0, 1, 2) and resample by interpolating nearest planes.
- Sorting issues are related to using “Image Position Patient” and “Image Orientation Patient” over “Instance Number” for accuracy.

---

🖥️ **How to implement multi-monitor support on OHIF? I have seen some issues and discussions regarding it but is there any timeline on it?**
- Multi-monitor support has been partially implemented in [PR #4178](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/4178), though not yet merged.
- It is not a priority but remains on the roadmap for future releases.

---

🔄 **1. Availability of rotation matrix - how's rotation/projection facilitated in Cornerstone 3D? Are those codes exposed?**
- Rotation matrices can be implemented using tools like [gl-matrix](https://glmatrix.net/docs/module-mat4.html).
- Start with destination coordinates for interpolation and resampling.

---

📐 **GetViewMatrix only gives current camera orientation. But if the patient orientation is axial and volume is displayed as coronal, some transformation is needed. Camera matrix is not updated with this. Where can we get this information?**
- Use the camera’s `view plane normal` and calculate the transformation matrix manually.
- ITK-VASM is recommended for voxel transformations and resampling scalar data.
- For 3D Slicer users: Ensure coordinate system compatibility (LPS vs. RAS).

---

🦋 **I'm having trouble with a specific type of DICOM images (butterfly files) in my viewer. When I use the direct address of dcm4chee in the local.js file, the images display correctly in Firefox but not in Google Chrome.**
- Likely a CORS issue. Check the network tab for failed requests.
- Ensure direct DICOM fetch bypasses backend if required.
- Report anonymized data if issues persist.

---

🚀 **How is the `maxNumberOfWebWorkers` configuration used for image loading? Shouldn’t increasing it speed up the image loading process?**
- Increasing web workers beyond 3-4 doesn’t improve performance due to overhead and thread management limits.
- Use progressive loading and efficient transfer syntaxes (e.g., JPEG 2000) for further optimization.
- Example: [Progressive loading docs](https://docs.cornerstonejs.org/concepts/progressive-loading).

---

📦 **What resources should I use for migrating applications from earlier OHIFs to the new OHIF version, specifically for segmentations? How does the new OHIF version handle temporarily storing the segmentations (instead of pushing them to Google Cloud instantly, for example)?**
- Migration resources: [OHIF Migration Guide](https://docs.ohif.org).
- For segmentation storage, consider RLE encoding and Gzipping data for backups. Use local storage or IndexedDB for temporary storage.

---

🫀 **We want to implement segmentation with cropping options for a 3D VTK model of heart ultrasound. While we’ve created our own implementation with a separate button, the requirement is to display it in MPR view as a 3D 4-up view. Is it possible to simply replace the component display?**
- Create a custom extension in OHIF to register a viewport type.
- Follow examples like DICOM SR or Chart Viewport for creating custom viewports.
- Reference: [Cornerstone VTK integration guide](https://docs.cornerstonejs.org).

---

🖊️ **I want to create a bounding box on DICOM image like this: `{Top: 1200px, Left: 1400px, Width: 200px, Height: 200px}` in OHIF. I want it to remain in position during zoom/pan.**
- Use Cornerstone’s annotation tool for manual testing first.
- Programmatically, refer to the DICOM SR loading code for annotations.
- A dynamically added annotation example will be provided soon.

---

📋 **Why are volume `imageIds` reversed in custom image load strategies (e.g., interleaveTopToBottom)?**
- Reversals occur during loading due to anatomical positioning (head-first vs. feet-first).
- Sorting is based on “Image Position Patient” for accurate spatial alignment rather than “Instance Number.”
