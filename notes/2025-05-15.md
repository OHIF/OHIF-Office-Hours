## ✅ Questions and summarized answers



🖍️ **Is there any way we can choose which displayset an annotation is using ? Particularly on a fusion viewport, we want the annotation to use the PT displayset instead of the CT one.**

* The fusion demo *should* respect the “active volume” you set when the tool-group is initialised.

  * Check **`initToolGroup`** (usually in `index.tsx`): make sure each tool definition includes the correct **`volumeId`** (e.g. the PT stack).
  * The helper **`setFusionActiveVolume`** must be called *after* both volumes are created so the PT ID becomes default for all annotation tools.
* At the moment the sample code in the repo is stale—volumeId is never forwarded, so the annotation silently falls back to the first (CT) volume. Updating that config or sending a PR will restore the behaviour.

🔄 **I’m working on a Cornerstone3D app that lets users switch between DICOM (wadouri:) and NIfTI (nifti:) volumes … after each switch I sometimes get `removeImageLoadObject: imageId was not present in imageCache` … How do I switch safely, and are there plans to improve this?**

* The error is harmless—Cornerstone is trying to evict an imageId that was already purged when the modality changed.

  * A quick fix accepted by the maintainers: in `cache.js` wrap the call with

    ```js
    if (!imageLoadObj) {
      console.warn('imageId not found in cache, skipping');
      return;
    }
    ```

    and open a PR.
* Today NIfTI support is “best-effort”:

  * No automated tests yet, so edge-cases (mixed DICOM/NIfTI workflows, aggressive cache clearing) aren’t bullet-proof.
  * The team plans to harden it but it isn’t on the short-term roadmap—community PRs or sponsored work can accelerate it.
* Until then:

  * Don’t purge the whole cache; instead use **`decacheIfNecessaryUntilBytesAvailable()`** *after* the new series has started to stream.
  * Keep separate `RenderingEngine` instances for DICOM and NIfTI if you need absolute isolation.

⏳ **Any idea on this issue? Why was it done in the first place? (Loading a new image while another is still loading breaks the app after v3.7.2)**

* The regression came from a refactor that now assumes the first fetch finishes before the next starts.
* Work-around: test `data.fetchStatus` before accessing the image data; if it’s still `loading`, abort or queue the second request.
* Proposed fix: add internal guards so the loader ignores overlapping requests; a PR is welcome.
* Issue thread: [https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/2065](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/2065)

📐 **How can we tell when a viewport is ready for operations like `worldToCanvas`?**

* Every viewport exposes **`viewportStatus`**—possible values: `loading`, `reading`, `preRender`, `rendered`, `resized`.
* Listen for the first **`imageRendered`** event, then unsubscribe:

  ```js
  const handler = evt => {
    element.removeEventListener('imageRendered', handler);
    // safe to call worldToCanvas here
  };
  element.addEventListener('imageRendered', handler);
  ```
* You can inspect all event names in `@cornerstonejs/core/enums/events.ts` for other hooks such as `cameraModified`.

---

🔑 **annotation manager `groupKey` – some tools depend on it being the Frame-of-Reference UID**

* The core helpers **`filterAnnotationsForViewport`** and reference-cursor / cross-hair tools still assume the groupKey *is* the Frame-of-Reference UID.
* Long-term plan: make every tool look at **metadata.frameOfReferenceUID** instead of the `groupKey`, so you can freely use `seriesInstanceUID` or anything else.
* Locate any hard-coded checks and submit a PR—the maintainers will merge it.

---

📊 **Segment statistics only appear after opening DevTools and reloading—bug?**

* Yes—there is a race condition in the stats panel; opening DevTools slows the thread just enough for it to complete.
* A patch is already in progress; expect it to land in the next release.

---

🖥️ **Best way to instantiate multiple viewers in React (share a rendering engine?)**

* Easiest path: use the *OHIF Viewer* React wrapper—built-in layout manager, configurable panels, grant-funded and maintained until 2028.

  * Docs & live examples: [https://docs.ohif.org/](https://docs.ohif.org/)
* If you roll your own:

  * Create **one `RenderingEngine` per logical viewer** when you need isolation, or share a single engine and create multiple `Viewport`s when memory is tight.
  * OHIF’s layout code is a reference implementation—you can lift just the components you need.

---

🎯 **Length, FreehandROI, SplineROI, Ellipse, Rectangle… are all annotation tools saved as points; can I save an exact mask (image-index array) from them?**

* Yes—every annotation is stored in tool-state:

  ```js
  cornerstoneTools.annotation.state.getAnnotations();
  ```

  * For a FreehandROI: `annotation.data.handles.points` is the *world* polyline.
* Convert to indices:

  1. **Canvas ➜ World** – `viewport.canvasToWorld(pt)`
  2. **World ➜ Image** – `viewport.worldToImage(pt)`
* For SplineROI, call `splineInstance.getPolylinePoints(resolution)` to densify the contour.

  * Current default is `resolution:20`; expose it in the tool config (needs a small PR).
* Once you have image-space integer coordinates you can rasterise them into a mask or export as JSON for back-end processing.

---

🐞 **Best way to debug tools? Is there a debug mode?**

* There’s no special debugger—treat it like any web app: Chrome DevTools, breakpoints, `console.log`, React DevTools.
* For tool-state, call `window.cornerstoneTools.annotation.state.dump()` in the console to inspect live annotations.

---

🗜️ **Passing a blob URL to `createNiftiImageIdsAndCacheMetadata` fails for compressed `.nii.gz`; I patched it locally to accept an `isCompressed` flag.**

* Maintainers agree with the change—please open a PR and it will be merged.
