## Q & A

attendees: 5



## 📌 One-line summaries

- 🔍 Why does adding a new segmentation change the zoom level on axial viewports?
- 🧠 When should commands vs. services be used for application or business logic?
- 🧭 Why does Nifti data with non-axial orientation not render properly in the viewer?

## ✅ Questions and summarized answers

🔍 **Do you know the reason why when we first add a new segmentation, the zoom changes on the axial viewports?**
- This issue seems to occur across many datasets, not just a specific one.
  - “Probably all. I tested a lot and it always does it.”
- The issue appears to involve an automatic zoom-out when adding segmentation in the axial viewport.
- It doesn’t happen with all data – some datasets behave normally.
  - “You see it doesn’t happen for this one. Interesting… I wonder…”
- The version 3.8 didn’t exhibit this behavior, suggesting a regression in later versions.
- The team suspects it might be related to “rough stack reports” and have requested that a bug be filed for further investigation.

🧠 **Any recommendations on when to use commands vs. services for adding application/business logic? Are there specific use cases for using one vs. the other?**
- General recommendation:
  - Use **services** when you need to manage or persist state over time. Services can fire and subscribe to events.
  - Use **commands** for pure logic that always behaves the same given the same inputs (stateless).
- Zustand stores (a newer addition) can function like services but offer a better developer experience within React.
  - They re-render React components automatically when state changes, unlike services that require manual event handling.
- Commands are often used in extensions (e.g., DICOM SCG) for segmentations (generation, download, storage).
- Commands integrate easily with hotkeys, while services do not.
- Zustand stores vs. services:
  - Zustand is more flexible, allowing state slicing and efficient subscriptions.
  - “In the future, if I want to develop a service, I will first ask: can I make this a store?”
- There are no plans to replace commands with stores.
  - "Stores won’t replace commands. But when designing a new service, we might use a store instead."
- Commands can be overridden by extensions. If two have the same name, OHIF will decide which one runs.

🧭 **Nifti data in a different orientation than axial is not rendered correctly (nifti-volume-loader)**
- Yes, this is a known issue and has been reported.
- The problem arises because the loader does not recognize non-axial orientations, resulting in incorrect rendering.
  - “Basically the data itself has a different orientation than axial which is somehow not recognized by the nifty-volume loader.”
- The demonstration showed three datasets: axial (correct), sagittal and coronal (not rendered correctly).
- A bug ticket has been created for this.
- The team is open to looking into it more deeply post-release and may provide guidance on where the bug resides for external contribution.
  - “I would like to investigate that... maybe I can point you to the location that’s happening and you can take it.”
