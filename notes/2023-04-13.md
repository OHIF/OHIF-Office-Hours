# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2023-04-13

## Q & A

### Validator.js is not getting maintained anymore

A: maybe we should consider seeing if more popular libraries like Zod can do the job for us

---

### Difference between cornerstone legacy and cornerstone 3D crosshairs, in v3 seems like it is limited to MPR

A: nothing is shared from legacy; crosshairs works in TMTV; crosshairs does not work for stack viewports

---

### Versioning of the OHIF Viewer, and the status of v3

A: v3 finalized by end of month. Adding RT and pathology viewer. Cornerstone wado image loader to new library. And then push to master.

Need to get better at versioning. Do not rely on version in package.json. Master branch is v2. v3-stable branch is v3 (and will soon be merged to master). V3 is built on top of cornerstone 3D. If starting fresh, start from v3.
