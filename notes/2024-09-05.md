üîß **What is the correct way to toggle a toolbar icon on/off? setToolActive doesn't seem to work for the image slice sync icon that I moved to the toolbar.**

A: The issue is related to how the synchronizer type is being retrieved from the button configuration. The current code doesn't handle all possible cases. Here's the problematic part:

const synchronizerType = isArray
         ? button.commands?.[0].commandOptions.type
         : button.commands?.commandOptions.type ?? button.props?.commands?.commandOptions.type;

To fix this, you need to modify the code to handle all possible cases of where the synchronizer type might be stored in the button configuration. Create a PR with the fix, ensuring that it checks for the synchronizer type in all potential locations within the button object.

The evaluators are responsible for styling, while commands are executed when a button is clicked. Make sure the evaluator for the image slice sync icon is correctly implemented to reflect its active/inactive state.

üñºÔ∏è **I have one DICOM file that is being rendered when I upload locally(https://viewer.ohif.org/local), but rendering is not working when I host it on orthanc or GCP. Any idea please? I can share my screen and show issue that is happening now.**

A: The issue is likely related to metadata handling, specifically with bulk data URIs. Here are the steps to troubleshoot and fix:

1. For GCP:
   - Use the v1beta1 endpoint instead of v1 in your configuration.
   - Enable bulk data URL resolution in your configuration.

2. For Orthanc:
   - Check if bulk data URL is enabled in your configuration.
   - Adjust the startsWith and prefixWith settings in the data source configuration.
   - Orthanc may have issues with relative paths for bulk data URLs.

3. General steps:
   - Ensure the bulk data URL is correctly configured and accessible.
   - Check if the metadata provider is correctly handling the bulk data URI.
   - Verify that the image overlay tool can access and render the bulk data.

If the issue persists, examine the network requests to see if the bulk data is being fetched correctly. You may need to modify the prefix or path handling for the bulk data URL in your server configuration.

üóÇÔ∏è **How can we load images or a whole study from local .dcm files?**

A: To load local DICOM files in OHIF:

1. For web-based viewing:
   - Use the /local route on viewer.ohif.org to drag and drop files.
   - This method keeps data in the browser and doesn't upload to any server.

2. For Electron app or local usage:
   - Implement a local server to serve DICOM files.
   - Options for server implementation:
     a. Use a JSON endpoint to serve metadata and file URLs.
     b. Use the static-wado tool to create a DICOM web compatible folder structure.

3. Security considerations:
   - Be cautious with patient data storage on disk.
   - Consider encrypting or hashing sensitive information.

4. Implementation steps:
   - Set up a local server (Python, Go, etc.)
   - Use static-wado-creator to prepare files if using that approach.
   - Configure OHIF to use your local server as the data source.

Remember to handle patient data securely and consider implementing encryption for sensitive information stored locally.

üö© **Can you guide me on how to add an image or icon, like a flag, to mark a frame in the OHIF viewer? I'm currently using version 3.8.3,i can share my screen and explain**

A: To add an icon or flag to mark a frame in OHIF:

1. Use the existing keyImageTool in Cornerstone as a starting point.
2. The implementation is in the stack annotation tools in Cornerstone.
3. To customize:
   - Modify the renderAnnotation function in the key image tool.
   - You can change the icon, color, or drawing method.

4. Current implementation:
   - Uses drawArrow function to render the icon.
   - Position is configurable via canvasPosition.

5. To add a custom icon:
   - You may need to implement a drawIcon function.
   - Load your icon image and render it at the specified position.

6. Considerations:
   - The position of the icon is configurable.
   - You can extend the key image tool to support multiple icon types.

7. Steps to implement:
   - Locate the key image tool in Cornerstone.
   - Modify the render function to use your custom icon.
   - Ensure the tool can be added to the toolbar and activated.

Consider creating a PR to add support for custom icons in the key image tool if you implement this functionality.

üîÑ **How can we show a loading when changing series?**

A: This question wasn't directly addressed during the office hours. However, based on OHIF's architecture, here are some general guidelines:

1. Identify the event that triggers series change in OHIF.
2. Use a state management solution (e.g., React context or Redux) to track loading state.
3. Create a loading component that can be displayed over the viewport.
4. Trigger the loading state when series change begins.
5. Hide the loading component when the new series is fully loaded.

Example approach:
1. Modify the series change handler to set a loading state.
2. Create a LoadingOverlay component.
3. Render the LoadingOverlay conditionally based on the loading state.
4. Update the loading state once the new series is loaded.

Consider submitting a feature request or PR to add this functionality to OHIF core if it's not already available.

üß† **I'd like to implement some automated segmentation tools in CS3D. I'm trying to understand how to efficiently share pixel data from CS3D -> my algorithm, and pass segmentations back from my algorithm -> CS3D. Do you have any recommendations or guidance? Should the incoming segmentations from the algorithm be formatted as a volume, contours, or some other format?**

A: For implementing automated segmentation tools in Cornerstone 3D:

1. Segmentation representations:
   - Volume (label map)
   - Contours
   - Surface

2. Data flow:
   - Access pixel data from Cornerstone 3D
   - Process in your algorithm
   - Return segmentation data to Cornerstone 3D

3. Recommended approach for volume segmentations:
   - Use createAndCacheDerivedSegmentationVolume function
   - Fill the segmentation volume with your algorithm's output
   - Call triggerSegmentationDataModified to update rendering

4. Example implementation:
   - See the label map rendering example in Cornerstone 3D
   - It demonstrates creating a mock segmentation

5. Future changes (Cornerstone 2.0):
   - Direct access to scalar data will change
   - New abstraction layer for accessing volume data

6. Considerations:
   - Choose representation based on your use case (volume vs contours)
   - Volume segmentations allow for 3D viewing and MPR
   - Contours are lighter but limited to 2D representation

7. Implementation steps:
   - Access source image data
   - Run your segmentation algorithm
   - Create a derived segmentation volume
   - Fill the volume with segmentation data
   - Trigger update to render the new segmentation

Refer to the Cornerstone 3D documentation and examples for detailed implementation guidance.

üñºÔ∏è **I have an image in planar configuration 1 that shows up as 3x3 small images**

A: The issue is related to handling Planar Configuration 1 in the image loader. Here's what was discussed:

1. The problem was fixed in the old cornerstone WADO image loader but may not be implemented in the new version.

2. The fix involves properly handling the Planar Configuration in the color space conversion.

3. Potential solution:
   - In the createImage function, modify the isColorConversionRequired check:
   - Add a condition to return true if planarConfiguration is 1 for RGB images

4. Proposed fix:
   Add this condition to the isColorConversionRequired function:
   
   if (photometricInterpretation === 'RGB' && imageFrame.planarConfiguration === 1) {
     return true;
   }

5. The old implementation was more complex, handling various cases like JPEG baseline 8-bit color. The new implementation aims to simplify this.

6. Next steps:
   - Implement the fix in the current cornerstone image loader
   - Test with various Planar Configuration 1 images
   - Create a PR with the fix for the OHIF team to review

This fix should allow proper rendering of Planar Configuration 1 images without the 3x3 small images issue.

üîÑ **Can I use progressive image load strategy that cornerstone provided for JLSMixed volume loader, like for thumbnail to lossless image transition while during volume load? Can you please provide high level design inputs what all area changes are required on OHIF side to support this loading mechanism, JLSMixed**

A: Regarding the JLSMixed progressive loading strategy:

1. JLSMixed approach:
   - Requires non-standard backend server configuration
   - Needs additional paths for lower resolution thumbnail versions

2. Implementation in OHIF:
   - Use the configuration defined in Cornerstone side
   - Apply it globally in OHIF configuration

3. Server requirements:
   - Must support the specific paths for thumbnails and full-resolution images
   - Don't apply to arbitrary servers as it may cause unfulfillable requests

4. Loading strategy:
   - Uses a progressive iterator
   - Can return multiple results for a single image (thumbnail and full resolution)
   - Configures both paths and iteration order

5. Loading process:
   - Starts with most important images (first, middle, last)
   - Proceeds with low-quality versions of every fourth image
   - Fills in with high-quality versions
   - Continues until all images are loaded at full quality

6. Implementation steps:
   - Implement the progressive iterator in OHIF
   - Configure the paths for thumbnail and full-resolution images
   - Set up the iteration configuration for loading order
   - Ensure the volume loader can handle multiple responses per image

7. Considerations:
   - Balance between initial load speed and full-quality rendering
   - Ensure server can handle the specific request patterns

To implement this in OHIF, you'll need to integrate the progressive loading strategy from Cornerstone into the OHIF volume loading process, ensuring that the configuration and server capabilities align with this approach.
