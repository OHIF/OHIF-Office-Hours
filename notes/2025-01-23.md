📽️ **In cine player, does frame per second mean slice per second for modalities like CT? What does frameTimeVector mean?**  
- Yes, in cine player for CT, frame per second corresponds to slices per second.  
- **frameTimeVector** is a tag primarily used for 4D imaging; it specifies how frames are grouped based on frame reference time.  
- Cine player can handle 4D data with large datasets (e.g., 10,000 slices in PET).  
- Frame rate rendering is not guaranteed and can depend on the system, browser, and data source.  
- Feature request: Add a warning if actual frame rate deviates from the desired rate by more than 10%.  
- The team discussed implementing a high-resolution timer to measure frame intervals and trigger warnings if they exceed set thresholds.

🔬 **If I remember correctly, the microscopy viewer in the current OHIF does not support segmentation. However, slim viewer (based on dicom-microscopy-viewer) seems to support segmentation. Is there any way to enable segmentation in the dicom-microscopy-viewer as slim does?**  
- Slim viewer supports segmentation using Labelmaps or contours; however, current OHIF microscopy mode does not.  
- There are two modes for slide microscopy data:  
  - **Basic viewer mode**: Uses cornerstone extensions and lacks advanced segmentation.  
  - **Slim viewer mode**: Uses Slim viewer embedded in OHIF, which supports segmentation.  
- Enhancing current OHIF functionality requires collaboration and funding. Slim viewer mode offers an easier starting point for adding segmentation.

📂 **While fetching a DICOM, is there a way to limit the size of the file received from the server?**  
- **HTJ2K** (High Throughput JPEG 2000) supports progressive rendering and reduced file sizes.  
- Other options include **JPEG 2000** or **JPEG XL**, though JPEG XL is not yet supported.  
- Use separate transfer syntax files with lower resolution (like JLS thumbnail).  
- Example implementation for progressive loading:  
  [Stack Progressive Loading Example](https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/stackprogressive)

🖼️ **For some DICOM images, 3D rendered segmentations fail to be located properly. Is this a known issue?**  
- This is a known issue for certain datasets, likely due to surface origin misalignments.  
- Follow related GitHub issue or Slack discussions for updates.  

Example dataset: [Viewer with faulty segmentation](https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/viewer?StudyInstanceUIDs=1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.32.35162.30000015050317233592200000046)

🗑️ **I raised this PR for deleting active annotations using backspace/delete key. Could you please review it?**  
- The `deleteAnnotation` function is currently UI-specific and removes annotations from React state.  
- Recommendation: Use `measurementService.remove()` instead to ensure proper cornerstone and state synchronization.  

---

✏️ **Programmatically adding spline ROI.**  
- Adding spline ROIs dynamically currently requires calling a private method (`getSplineConfig`) on the instance.  
- **Issue**: Private methods cause TypeScript warnings.  
- Recommendation: Modify options to pass in an instance of the spline ROI tool with appropriate configuration.  
- Suggested solution: Update the hydrate method to support dynamic spline creation using tool instances.  

---

🔄 **I found a bug in CT studies where the left/right label does not update correctly after flipping and scrolling.**  
- The issue is reproducible: After flipping an image, scrolling reverts the flip and causes label mismatches.  
- Bug identified as two-fold:  
  - Flip not preserved during scrolling.  
  - Label updates are inconsistent after flipping.  
- A GitHub bug report was suggested for resolution.  

---

🚨 **Wondering if repeated "ImagePositionPatientToUse: undefined" warnings can trigger a "something went wrong false" error. How can we suppress these warnings?**  
- The warning appears in the console when ultrasound images lack the `ImagePositionPatient` field.  
- Recommendation: Upgrade to OHIF 3.9.3, as recent PRs addressed related issues.  
- If unresolved, errors can be suppressed by modifying the error boundary component:  
  [Error Boundary Code](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/blob/9d07705a1fb34440a3eaee19624b9f246d8ba588/platform/ui-next/src/components/Errorboundary/ErrorBoundary.tsx#L59).

🧪 **Is there a source of HTJ2K studies for testing?**  
- HTJ2K data is available but often in DICOMweb format.  
- Suggested sources:  
  - [Cornerstone Codecs Test Fixtures](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/codecs/tree/main/packages/openjphjs/test).  
  - Use tools like CMTK to generate test studies.  
- Posting data to Orthanc endpoints can also generate HTJ2K format studies.  

---

🛠️ **Could you please update the status of PR created for memory-related issues?**  
- The PR addresses excessive memory usage in `voxelManager`.  
- Recommendation: Use a soft reference to scalar data from the image to reduce memory footprint.  
- The team plans to test the fix to ensure no unintended breaks.
