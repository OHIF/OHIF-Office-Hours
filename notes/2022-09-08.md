## Update to Hanging Protocols in OHIF v3

Hanging Protocol engine is now getting applied on the displaySets instead of series (https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/2837 )

- Series to displaySets are not always 1-to-1 relationship
- The pros include now you can hang displayset instead of series
- There is a little bit of initial wait time until metadata arrives, but deduplication of metadata for study metadata (factor of 10 reduction) is an idea that we are planning to work with DICOM working group
- The new standard can be built on the existing standards
- Bill is working on a new loader to work with deduplicated data
  - Reconstitute data from deduplicated format instead of DICOM Web
  - Speed improvement is roughly 10 times faster than regular
    -The data is already stored in dcmjs-normalized format and it doesn’t need normalizer again, so we don’t need the `dcmjs.naturalizeDataSet`

## Cornerstone3D Reference Lines

Reference lines implementation in Cornerstone3D not done yet

- Clinically there is no thin slice sent to the pacs
- Usually there is thicker slices so reference lines helps
- We have grant that we might be able to mentor the implementation of the reference lines by community

## DICOMWeb

Clinical systems often don’t have access to dicom web interface, DIMSE to move images to dicomweb in Orthanc then OHIF, best practices for transferring studies, or is there a better way at all? Ideally click on study and be able to open it OHIF as quickly as possible

- Static-dicomweb (https://github.com/RadicalImaging/Static-DICOMWeb) has some pieces to do series level proxy
- Unless you have Hanging Protocol that matches just with Series level query it is hard to lay something on screen
- Usually Study and series level query -> metadata fetch -> image fetch’
  - If it is part10, then you can store image data at the same time

## HotKeys Bugs

Series switching by hotkeys in master branch is now fixed thanks to Doug Horner

- V3 does not have this feature yet
- Would it makes sense so that next series would be based on the matching score
- https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/blob/v3-stable/extensions/tmtv/src/getHangingProtocolModule.js#L118-L162
- Yes it makes sense

## Matching on Prior Studies

A feature to match priors for hanging protocols is important in clinical settings

- Currently not supported in V3

## Custom Data

Custom data to be added to OHIF
