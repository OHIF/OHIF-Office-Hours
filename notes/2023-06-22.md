## Q & A

### How can an extension override the existing datasource config in OHIF?

You might need the following PR to be merged first which allows for re-initializing the datasource:

https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/3427

besides that PR you may need to expose/add a method to update the config for a datasource and then reinitialize it

### if I bind to my host in Docker can I modify it real-time (might require a page refresh or 2, or turning off caching), but it seems that is where it maps to ?

You can take a look at the docker docs, which lets you to run the docker container with a volume mounted to your host machine. This way you can modify the code on your host machine and it will be reflected in the docker container, we are also working on an environment variable method to do this, stay tuned.

### What are the window.config extensions and modes

They provide a method to run ohif with specific modes (the extension field is not ready yet), but you can't use it at run time, you basically
need to set it before running the app.

### What are the minimum hardware requirements to run a basic setup and some that might be somewhat larger than that ?

Our rendering pipeline primarily relies on GPU acceleration, so having a capable GPU, preferably of tier 1 or higher (as mentioned at https://pmndrs.github.io/detect-gpu/), is beneficial. In cases where a GPU is unavailable or lacks sufficient power for advanced visualizations, we will fallback to CPU rendering for basic 2D rendering. However, it's important to note that CPU rendering does not support MPR or advanced visualizations.
