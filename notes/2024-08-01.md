üñºÔ∏è **Progressive loading in CS 3D: i am trying to run the progressive loading on the CS 3D stack viewport, so far, i have used Static-wado webserver and have converted DICOM p10 files to DICOM web format with tool given by Static-wado package itself, now, i am trying to use HTJ2k retrieval configuration with streaming:true, i am unable to do it. How can I configure Static-wado web-server to use streaming/byte-range? Also, is it possible to use another server than Static-wado server with streaming like Express.js or AWS Cloudfront?**

A: For HTJ2K streaming, any server should work as it's interpreted by the client. For JLS thumbnails, any server should work as long as it has additional paths for lower resolution versions. For byte-range requests, the server needs to support this feature. AWS CloudFront does support byte-range requests.

Example studies and documentation:
- https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/htj2kstackbasic
- https://www.cornerstonejs.org/docs/concepts/progressive-loading/retrieve-configuration

For HTJ2K RPCL configuration, it's a specific configuration of HTJ2K compression. You may need to convert your DICOM P10 files to this format using appropriate tools.

üîß **In a separate mode I'm modifying the toolbar and I'd like to move the image sync to the main toolbar instead of being under 'more'. However - it doesn't display and I don't see an error. When it is in its original location it works perfectly.**

A: To move a tool from the 'more' section to the main toolbar:

1. Add the tool's ID to the primary section in the toolbar configuration:

```javascript
toolbarService.createButtonSection('primary', [
  'MeasurementTools',
  'Zoom',
  'Pan',
  'TrackballRotate',
  'WindowLevel',
  'Capture',
  'Layout',
  'Crosshairs',
  'MoreTools',
  'ImageSliceSync', // Add your tool ID here
]);
```

2. Ensure the tool is properly defined in the toolbar buttons configuration.

The order of IDs in the primary array determines the order of tools in the toolbar.

üîç **I want to add some custom filters, so when the studies api is called (as ohif viewer starts) and all the studies list get rendered in the table, how can i add some custom string in the studies url to get the desired result?**

A: To add custom filters to the studies API call:

1. Modify the `DataSourceWrapper.tsx` file where the API call is initiated.
2. Look for the `getData()` function and the `dataSource.query.studies.search()` call.
3. You may need to modify the `DicomWebDataSource/index.js` file to include your custom parameters in the `mapParams` function.

Example:

```javascript
query: {
  studies: {
    mapParams: mapParams.bind(),
    search: async function (origParams) {
      // Add your custom parameters here
      const { studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid, ...mappedParams } =
        mapParams(origParams, {
          supportsFuzzyMatching: dicomWebConfig.supportsFuzzyMatching,
          supportsWildcard: dicomWebConfig.supportsWildcard,
        }) || {};

      // Use mappedParams in your API call
      const results = await qidoSearch(qidoDicomWebClient, undefined, undefined, mappedParams);

      return processResults(results);
    },
  },
}
```

For more complex customizations, consider using the Customization Service to modify the worklist behavior.

üßä **If I have a wild pelvic organ, such as the prostate, and it is surrounded by other soft tissues, it will be quite difficult for me to isolate it on 3D both with my hands and through the pressor. Is there any way to prepare (clean) dicom to show the organ clearly in 3D?**

A: Isolating soft tissues like the prostate in 3D rendering can be challenging due to similar intensities. Some approaches:

1. Use different presets for volume rendering (e.g., MR-specific presets).
2. Manually adjust transfer functions using the transfer function editor.
3. Consider segmentation-based volume rendering for better isolation.

For MRI, standard presets may not work as well as they do for CT due to non-standardized intensities. Manual adjustment of transfer functions or segmentation may be necessary for clear visualization.

Example of advanced rendering: https://deploy-preview-636--cornerstone-3d-docs.netlify.app/live-examples/volumeviewport3d

üé® **Do I understand correctly that segmentation can be applied only on dicom slides in 2D, in 3D segmentation cannot be applied?**

A: Segmentation can be applied in both 2D and 3D. While 2D segmentation is more common, 3D segmentation is possible and can be visualized in 3D. Support for 3D visualization of segmentations is coming soon in OHIF.

üé® **Palette color images don't seem to display in viewer or viewer-dev any longer, with a buffer size issue. Any ideas where to look to fix that?**

A: Check the `convertPALETTECOLOR.ts` file in the DICOM Image Loader. A recent change added a Promise.all to handle cases where the palette color needs to be fetched as a bulk data URI. This might be causing the issue you're experiencing.

File location: `packages/dicomImageLoader/src/imageLoader/colorSpaceConverters/convertPALETTECOLOR.ts`

‚û°Ô∏è **How to proceed making the arrow persistent in DICOM SR? Clunie's comment about this not being supported is very sensible.**

A: Since DICOM SR doesn't natively support arrow annotations with start and end points, some potential solutions include:

1. Use a private tag (not ideal, but doesn't break other implementations).
2. Add a second point with a different name (e.g., "arrow end").
3. Include angle and length as scalar values in the annotation.
4. Create a new tool specifically for SR-compatible arrows:
   - Only require one click (like a probe)
   - Force the end to be a configurable distance/direction from the start
   - Always render in a consistent way relative to the viewport

The team is considering changing the arrow representation to use one world coordinate point and a relative canvas size for the endpoint.

üñºÔ∏è **For HTJ2k Progressive loading, CS 3D documentation says, "server need to support HTJ2K RPCL configuration" What is this configuration?**

A: The HTJ2K RPCL configuration refers to a specific transfer syntax for encoding images in HTJ2K (High Throughput JPEG 2000) format. It's not a server requirement but a data requirement. If you're using a PACS or DICOM Web server, it needs to be able to provide images in this format.

RPCL stands for Resolution, Position, Component, Layer, which is an internal configuration of HTJ2K that supports progressive decoding. To use this, you may need to convert your DICOM P10 files to the HTJ2K RPCL format using appropriate tools.

üîß **I'm experiencing issues running the Docker-Nginx-Orthanc version of the app in dev mode (dev:orthanc). It's a configuration issue. The app is trying to query localhost:3000 instead of calling localhost:8042.**

A: For local development with Orthanc:

1. Use the command: `APP_CONFIG=config/local_orthanc yarn dev`
2. Make sure Orthanc is running (you can use `docker-compose up` for the Orthanc container)
3. Check your `local_orthanc.js` configuration file to ensure it's pointing to the correct Orthanc address

If you're still having issues, it might be related to recent changes in authentication configurations. Review your Nginx and Orthanc configurations to ensure they're up to date with the latest OHIF requirements.

üõ†Ô∏è **When I do a yarn run build I get the following with a vanilla clone. I have gotten past this by manually downloading and linking the newest @kitware but it has it's own problems with issues when running . Am I missing something?**

A: The issue seems to be related to the @kitware/vtk.js package. Try these steps:

1. Delete the yarn link folder: `/Users/alireza/.config/yarn/link`
2. Ensure you're using Node.js version 18 (try switching if you're on 20)
3. Remove any existing links to @kitware/vtk.js
4. Run a fresh install: `yarn install`
5. Try building again: `yarn build`

If the issue persists, it might be due to recent changes in the vtk.js package or how it's being imported in the project. You may need to update the import statements or check for any recent breaking changes in the vtk.js library.
