## Q & A

Q: UI Viewport Dialog does not show notification when called .show

A: This seemed to be a bug related to using TrackedCornerstoneViewport, we debugged and fixed it [here](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/3071)

---

Q: Measurement updates when textBox moves

A: It seems like there is a PR for it [here](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D-beta/pull/296), but
we should have another event (separated from the ANNNOTATION_MODIFIED event) that is triggered when the textbox is moved.

Q: How segmentation rendering happening in OHIF v2 (Labelmap3D)

A: It is using CornerstoneTool legacy to render. If you can switch to @cornerstonejs/tools it will support native
3D rendering when loading DICOM Segmentation objects.

---

Q: Can we edit segmentations in OHIF v3 (loaded DICOM SEG) with tools

A: We are planning to add that, and certainly on the near future roadmap. It will probably be a Segmentation
mode with a set of tools that can be used to edit the segmentation.

---

Q: Problem with rotation with VolumeRotateMouse wheel tool. In some series it changes the slice index as well

A: The configuration of the tool (currently Z axis) should be optional which should act on acquisition plane instead of Z axis if not specified.

---

Q: CSWIL error handling inside webworker

A: Apparently if a decode task fails, the webworker will throw the error, but then the webworker manager
will not catch it and will not make the webworker available again. We should fix that. PR is [here](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstoneWADOImageLoader/pull/492).
