## OHIF and Firebase:

Firebase app credentials to get transferred to OHIF and OHIF only gives access to those who have credentials. Currently, we are doing accounts created in Google SDK and Firebase using OpenID Connect. DICOM images are stored in Google Healthcare API.

**Answer**:

- [Google Config for OHIF v3](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/blob/v3-stable/platform/viewer/public/config/google.js#L5-L22)
- You can setup your OAuth Client in the Firebase by
  - Firebase, authentication -> providers -> Add New Provider -> Google -> Web SDK Configuration
  - Open the same project in Google Cloud Console Credentials
  - Make sure they have the right origin for OHIF and It should supports redirect urls, and deploy url
  - Get the client ID and client secret from the top right and put it in the firebase
  - Emails can get added to the firebase

CORS issues in firebase can get resolved by putting a firebaes.json file in the root of OHIF, see below

## CORS in TMTV

Why the TMTV needs CORS but not others

**Answer**:

- TMTV uses Volume viewports which use SharedArrayBuffer and it has security requirements
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements

## Hanging Protocol Matching

TMTV hanging protocol has loose criteria for the matching which works on the study level metadata

**Answer**:

- The reason for this is the lazy loading of the series metadata which returns high level metadata
- CorrectedImage tag ideally can be used to accurately find the attenuated and unattenuated displaySets
- We can turn off the lazy loading to get access to instance level metadata but that will be a huge bottleneck for the large studies
- Middle ground (which is not implemented) is to fetch one instance from each series and from that we can have richer metadata
