—------------------------------------

Announcements by Bill:

Now there is an ability to query a single backend from multiple data sources `/?datasource=datasoucename`

Bill showed flexView.ai viewer which loads HTJ2K images by default, and deduplication metadata format which is quite smaller than normal dicomweb format.

Before GZIP it is around 20x smaller metadata format for a large study.
After GZIP (compared to dicomweb without Gzip) is around 100x smaller.
Compressing to GZIP is usually slower than the transfer time, but if stored in GZip it is fast.
