# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-08-15

## Q & A

Attendees: 9

Discussed:

🎨 **We are using the Orthanc OHIF plugin. My question is what is the easiest way to change the colors in the OHIF viewer, specifically the blue toolbar. Is there a way to do this in whiteLabeling config, or can we mount our own css file to replace OHIFs? Looking for whatever option is easiest to implement, and maintain considering newer OHIF versions in the future.**

A: There are two main options for customizing the colors in OHIF:

1. Modify the Tailwind CSS configuration:
   - Edit the file platform/app/tailwind.config.js
   - This file grabs presets from ui and ui-next tailwind configs
   - Modify the colors in this file to achieve your desired look

2. Use white labeling:
   - Search for "white labeling" in the OHIF documentation
   - This will show you how to customize the logo and other branding elements

For the easiest implementation and maintenance, modifying the Tailwind config is recommended as it allows for comprehensive color changes throughout the application.

🔐 **Hi! Unfortunately I couldn't join today's meeting. But if I could get some suggestions on how to decode user information now that OHIF is using oauth2-proxy, I would greatly appreciate it. I need user information (like username) to query another backend service. Before oauth2-proxy, I was just sending the jwt token and I would decode the token in the backend service, but now from what I understand user information are stored in an encrypted cookie and I'm having trouble decrypting it either manually (cyberchef) or programmatically in my backend service. Any suggestion on how to retrieve user information either in OHIF or from oauth2-proxy directly?**

A: With the current setup using oauth2-proxy, user information is stored in an encrypted cookie. Here are some suggestions to retrieve the user information:

1. Backend access: The backend should be able to access the cookie and decrypt it to get the user information.

2. Nginx configuration: Since Nginx acts as a backend, you can modify its configuration to extract the user information from the oauth2-proxy and pass it as headers to OHIF.

3. oauth2-proxy configuration options:
   - Pass access token
   - Pass authorization header
   - Pass user headers
   - Inject response headers (including ID token)

4. For frontend access, you might need to send the cookie to the backend, process it, and send the required information back to the frontend.

To implement this, look into oauth2-proxy documentation for options like:
- pass-access-token
- pass-authorization-header
- pass-user-headers
- set-authorization-header

You may need to add a custom header in Nginx configuration to pass the ID token or user information to OHIF.

🖼️ **we have CT data rendered as Volume3D viewport, Where HP displaySetOption does not contain any preset, so default loading of Volume 3D is without any preset, now from dropdown user can select preset and that preset will be applied to volume 3D, Ask is on click on reset it should remove applied preset. Currently when we applied a preset, it applied all properties to the volume actor, & is there a way to reset this actor? There is a ResetProperties interface but it's not implemented for Volume3D.**

A: To reset a Volume3D viewport to its initial state without presets:

1. Understand that volume rendering without presets is generally not meaningful, as it often results in a solid cube.

2. Presets in volume rendering control various aspects:
   - Lighting (ambient, diffuse, specular)
   - Interpolation
   - Scalar opacity
   - Color transfer function

3. To implement a reset:
   - Store the initial state of the volume actor before applying any presets
   - Implement the ResetProperties interface for Volume3D
   - When resetting, revert to the stored initial state

4. If you need a custom initial state:
   - Create a custom preset that represents your desired initial state
   - Apply this custom preset when initializing the volume
   - Use this same preset when resetting

5. Consider using tools like VTK.js examples or 3D Slicer to experiment with and create custom presets that suit your specific CT data.

Remember that the scalar opacity and color transfer function are crucial for meaningful volume rendering. You may need to develop a custom preset that works well with your specific CT data of veins.

📅 **Can you please let me know the roadmap for Spine Labeling mentioned here - https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/3504**

A: Currently, Spine Labeling is not on the immediate roadmap for OHIF due to other priorities. However, here are some points to consider:

1. The feature is not very hard to implement, but it's not a current priority.

2. The main challenge is handling cross-sectional projection of labels across different viewports.

3. If you need this feature, you could potentially implement it yourself with some guidance from the OHIF team.

4. Key aspects to consider for implementation:
   - Handling label projection across different viewports
   - Ensuring labels update correctly when scrolling through slices
   - Potentially using a simplified version compared to the referenced video

5. The OHIF team can provide high-level architectural guidance if you decide to implement this feature.

If you decide to proceed with implementation, the team can provide more detailed guidance on the approach and integration with OHIF.

📊 **Followup from last week on multiple hanging protocols with a current and prior study. I don't see how the studyMatchingRules get applied. I can switch between stages but the images are from the same study.**

A: For study matching rules to work properly in hanging protocols:

1. Ensure that multiple study instance UIDs are included in the URL when loading the viewer. For example:
   https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/viewer?StudyInstanceUIDs=study1,study2

2. The studyMatchingRules only apply when multiple studies are loaded this way.

3. Check the HP Compare hanging protocol example in the OHIF codebase. It demonstrates how to set up comparisons between current and prior studies.

4. Look at the test cases for HP Compare, which show how to run the viewer with two studies for comparison.

5. If you're still having issues, ensure that you're using the correct syntax for specifying multiple studies in the URL and that your hanging protocol is correctly set up to handle multiple studies.

6. The documentation mentions that additional studies are accessible in the hanging protocol when specified in the URL.

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps, it might be worth creating a specific example or test case to help debug the problem.

🔍 **Where OHIF can I prioritize which study to load? For example, if I have few studies and I want to load the most recent or the one with the most amount of slides. Thanks.**

A: OHIF doesn't have a built-in mechanism to automatically prioritize loading based on recency or slide count. However, you have a few options:

1. Manual selection: When opening studies, you can manually select which one to load first.

2. Multiple study loading: You can load multiple studies simultaneously by including multiple StudyInstanceUIDs in the URL. For example:
   https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/viewer?StudyInstanceUIDs=study1,study2

3. Custom implementation: If you need automatic prioritization, you would need to implement this in your own code that interacts with OHIF. You could:
   - Sort studies by date or instance count before opening them in OHIF
   - Modify the OHIF code to implement custom sorting logic

4. Hanging Protocols: Use hanging protocols to define how multiple studies should be displayed when loaded together.

For the most flexibility, you might want to implement a custom study selection interface that allows sorting by date or instance count before launching the OHIF viewer with the selected studies.

🖼️ **An viewport overlay question: I've defined viewport overlays in the APP_CONFIG javascript and they work in the hanging protocol I've defined. If I drag another image to a viewport the overlays disappear. This doesn't happen in the 'Basic Viewer' mode. What sort of callback am I missing?**

A: The issue with disappearing viewport overlays when dragging new images seems to be related to how the customization is applied. Here are some points to consider:

1. Check the ViewportOverlay component in the OHIF codebase.

2. Ensure that your customization service is correctly set up and that the customizations are being applied consistently.

3. The issue might be related to how the instance data is being passed to the overlay component when dragging new images.

4. Try simplifying your overlay conditions to help isolate the problem. For example, set the condition to always return true:

   condition: () => true,

5. Debug the customization service to ensure it's being called correctly when new images are dragged into the viewport.

6. Check if the instance data is available when new images are dragged in. The disappearance might be due to missing instance data.

7. Consider adding error handling or default values in your overlay definitions to handle cases where instance data might be undefined.

This seems to be a potential bug in how OHIF handles overlay updates when dragging new images. Further investigation and possibly filing an issue on the OHIF GitHub repository might be necessary.

🔘 **The viewport Overlay menu item in the "Basic Viewer" does not toggle the overlays on and off. The menu item is enabled/disabled. There is the same behavior on the viewer.ohif.org web site.**

A: This issue wasn't directly addressed during the office hours. However, based on the context, it seems there might be a bug in the overlay toggle functionality in the Basic Viewer mode. Here are some suggestions:

1. Verify if this is a known issue by checking the OHIF GitHub issues.

2. Try to reproduce the issue in different environments and OHIF versions to isolate the problem.

3. Investigate the code responsible for handling the overlay toggle in the Basic Viewer mode.

4. Consider opening a new issue on the OHIF GitHub repository with a detailed description of the problem and steps to reproduce it.

5. In the meantime, you might need to implement a custom solution or workaround if you need this functionality urgently.

6. Keep an eye on future OHIF updates, as this might be addressed in upcoming releases.
