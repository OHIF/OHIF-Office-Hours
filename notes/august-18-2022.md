- Sean discussing the draft PR for the SR
    - adding CONTAINS as a new relationship type for 1410 SR
    - Not supports 3D SR but 2D part of the 1410
- Chris on image loading
    - turn string into object for imageId
        - putting information inside string and parsing out seems inconvenient compared to object stringify: e.g., imageReferenceObject ??
            
            ```jsx
            {
              loaderId: ...
            	loaderOptions: ...
            	data: ...
            	cacheKey: ...
            }
            ```
            
        - As soon as there is an object we can use a property of the object (cacheKey)
        - There is a good case for Cornerstone3D to do so (volume to image cache)
        - Other benefits might be performance gains
    - server that is storing data and cors issues and batch requests
        - By minimizing cors request for images by requesting them all → one cors request
            - extending CS to retrieve batch of images instead of single image, bundle up into one request
- Selim wants to discuss on RAM usage of the library
    - Only using Cornerstone3D
    - load a volume consisting on +300 slices
    - Profiling based on two baselines with oneVolume example and the code for oneVolume and the local data
    - Let’s double check if the fetched array buffer is not being garbage collected
- Ritesh doing POC on OHIF
    - Mobile use case (iphone etc)
    - Issue on MIP MPR giving our of memory on mobile (web works fine)
    - OHIF-v2 engine is getting deprecated for the volume rendering and OHIF-v3 is the future of OHIF
