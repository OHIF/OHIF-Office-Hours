# Questions and Summarized Answers

üéØ **The Automatic Segmentation with SAM 1 was going to be released by the end of November, was it released? If yes, how can I get it or use it?**
- SAM 1 Automatic Segmentation was released.
- You can use it by following the example documentation: [GPU Segmentation Tools Example](https://www.cornerstonejs.org/docs/examples#gpu-segmentation-tools).

üîí **I am looking to use the docs and the configuration from GitHub to set up, secure, and play around with dcm4chee and OHIF as the viewer. First, I noticed from the nginx-dcm4chee-keycloak, the dcm4chee Docker image used is for the unsecured dcm4chee. Is it possible to replace it with a secured dcm4chee image? Again, permit me to ask: if I want to isolate the setup separately from the GitHub repo, what considerations do I need to keep in mind, from config files, etc.? At the end of the day, I want to have a secured setup with dcm4chee and OHIF, all accessed via domain names and authenticated by Keycloak.**
- Yes, it is possible to replace the unsecured dcm4chee Docker image with a secured one. You can achieve this by ensuring the correct secure image is built and configured with Keycloak.
- When isolating the setup:
  - Ensure proper configurations for Nginx, Keycloak, and dcm4chee, keeping security settings in mind.
  - Use domain-specific configurations to support authentication.
  - Documentation and configuration examples from the GitHub repository can be used as a baseline.

üì∏ **We have ultrasound studies with ultrasound series and SR series. In some of the ultrasound studies, OHIF v3 displays the total instance count from both series and displays the SR instance thumbnail but does not display any ultrasound instance thumbnails. All of our other ultrasound studies are displayed properly by OHIF. Any suggestions of where to look to fix this?**
- This issue may be caused by incorrect metadata labeling or unsupported edge cases.
- Suggested actions:
  - Verify if the metadata for ultrasound thumbnails is accurate (e.g., modality tags).
  - Test the problematic studies on the latest OHIF version (3.9) by dragging and dropping data into [viewer.ohif.org/local](https://viewer.ohif.org/local).
  - If the issue persists, try the unstable beta viewer at [viewer-dev.ohif.org/local](https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/local).
  - Check sorting options for series in the study panel. Reference: [Technical FAQ - Sorting](https://docs.ohif.org/faq/technical#how-do-i-sort-the-series-in-the-study-panel-by-a-specific-value).
  - If unresolved, share anonymized data and file an issue for further investigation.

üöÄ **I am using OHIFv3. We have deployed it for our customers. However, some of our customers are facing very slow loading times with some CT studies with 1,000 instances or more. Studies with 4,000 instances are even slower. We deployed using DICOM JSON as the source. My questions: 1. Are there any config settings within OHIFv3 to speed up loading time? 2. Is there any overall memory config setting we could tweak to increase OHIF allocated memory to improve loading times?**
- Recommendations for improving performance:
  - Optimize the DICOM JSON by pruning unnecessary metadata fields. Reference: [Required Metadata List](https://docs.ohif.org/faq/technical#what-are-the-list-of-required-metadata-for-the-ohif-viewer-to-work).
  - Compress the DICOM JSON using Gzip and configure your server (e.g., S3) to serve compressed files.
    - Ensure the `Content-Encoding` header is set to `gzip`.
    - Compression significantly reduces file size and improves load times.
    - Example guide: [Serving Gzipped Assets](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8080824/how-to-serve-gzipped-assets-from-amazon-s3).
  - Profile loading bottlenecks:
    - Measure the time taken to load JSON vs. displaying the first image.
    - Analyze the network tab for excessive requests or latency.
  - Test OHIF locally on the latest versions: [OHIF 3.9 Local Viewer](https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/localbasic).

üìê **I want to make a 3D MIP synchronizer that will sync camera position relatively (two 3D viewports of two different studies with different world coordinates and sizes). At each camera position update, we have changes in camera position, focal point, and view up. We tried calculating the camera angle from camera events and computing the angle between two camera positions with the center of rotation in the viewport center. How do we manage focal point and view up?**
- Managing focal point and view up:
  - Use the camera position before and after events to calculate the required angles.
  - Synchronizing requires considering focal point, view up, and camera position transformations.
  - Floating-point drift can occur, so store the original positions and calculate deltas from them to maintain synchronization.
  - Reference: [VTK Trackball Rotate Code](https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-js/blob/051d54047227a253ebe0702a98b2ccbf8ea67e09/Sources/Interaction/Manipulators/MouseCameraUnicamRotateManipulator/index.js#L124).

üß© **I was not active last month and have lost an update on Cornerstone 2.0. Have we integrated it with OHIF? Are we good to take the latest master branch?**
- Yes, Cornerstone3D 2.0 has been integrated with OHIF.
- Migration resources:
  - Try OHIF locally: [OHIF Viewer 3.9](https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/localbasic).
  - Try Cornerstone3D locally: [Cornerstone3D Examples](https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/local.html).
  - Migration guide: [3.8 to 3.9 Migration Guide](https://docs.ohif.org/migration-guide/3p8-to-3p9/).

üîÑ **Is it possible to create a manual rectangle with a rotation? We also want to create a rotated rectangle through rectangleROI.createAndAddAnnotation. It works, but dragging it changes the shape to a rectangle without rotation. Is there a solution?**
- Solution:
  - Modify the `dragCallback` in the custom rectangle tool.
  - Add logic for detecting anchor points used for rotation. Override the drag behavior for rotated rectangles.
  - Example:
    - Check `dragCallback` in the rectangle ROI tool. Ensure proper handling of rotation anchors to retain the shape.

üîÅ **While volume load is in progress, say due to network unavailability (status code 0), if it fails to download a given batch of images, is there a way to retry those images for a certain time and stop requesting the next batch from the request pool?**
- Current behavior:
  - Failed requests in a batch are skipped, and the next batch is requested.
- Solution:
  - Implement custom error handling to track failed requests in a "failed bucket."
  - Retry requests in the bucket periodically until successful.
  - Use a fallback mechanism to stop further requests until failures are resolved.

üé• **Is it possible to use the synchronizer to sync the cine play frame rate of different viewports? E.g., to synchronize cardiac ultrasound by cardiac cycle.**
- Not currently possible; each viewport has a separate cine player.
- You can write a custom synchronizer.
  - Reference: [Sync Group Service](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/blob/master/extensions/cornerstone/src/services/SyncGroupService/createHydrateSegmentationSynchronizer.ts).
