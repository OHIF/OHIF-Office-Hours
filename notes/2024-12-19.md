# Questions and Summarized Answers
ðŸŒ€ **Question in Slack regarding Proxy object serializability with decode worker messages**
- The issue occurs when retrieve options for progressive loaders are wrapped as proxy objects. This appears to be caused by Vue's reactivity system when rendering engine instances are stored in reactive objects.
  - A workaround was to "sanitize" the retrieve options by converting them to JSON and back to plain objects before passing them to the worker.
  - Example fix:
    ```javascript
    let retrieveOptions = { streaming: true };
    retrieveOptions = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(retrieveOptions));
    ```
  - It's unclear whether Vue's reactive wrapping should be avoided entirely or handled more systematically.
  - Discussion: Adjustments might be needed within the Progressive Retrieve Images function (`progressiveRetrieveImages.ts`).

ðŸ“Š **How does OHIF track image load progress?**
- OHIF tracks load progress differently depending on the context:
  - **Single image loading:** Thereâ€™s no built-in mechanism to track percentages (e.g., 10%, 20% loaded) unless streaming is enabled and supported by the server.
  - **Stack loading (progressive):** Load progress is available and tracked in the streaming stack loader (e.g., HTJ2K progressive loading).
    - Metadata such as sub-resolutions and render progress are available for streaming decoders.
  - For volume viewports:
    - Events like `imageCacheImageAdded` and `volumeCompleted` help track how many slices are loaded.
    - OHIF has a PR (https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/4340) that improves progress indicators for series loading.
- For developers:
  - Use the `imageCacheImageAdded` event to track individual slices.
  - Use the `volumeCompleted` event for the overall series loading.

ðŸ“‚ **Added sort by Instance Number to getCustomizationModule.tsx in default extension. It works but how do I make it the default view?**
- To make the sorting by instance number the default, modify the logic in `PanelStudyBrowserTracking.tsx`:
  - Sorting logic should be implemented within the `useEffect` hook to ensure the default sort order is applied on initial render.
  - Example snippet:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      const sortedDisplaySets = currentDisplaySets.sort((a, b) => {
        return a.instanceNumber - b.instanceNumber;
      });
    }, [dependencies]);
    ```
  - Challenges:
    - Sorting during display set updates requires delaying the rendering pipeline until all display sets are loaded, which might introduce performance issues for large datasets.
    - Alternatively, handle sorting directly in the SOP class handler or metadata service to avoid client-side delays.

ðŸ“¦ **Should metadata be fully loaded and cached before an image loader runs?**
- Yes, preloading and caching metadata is recommended to ensure smooth rendering.
- Workflow:
  1. Fetch and cache metadata (e.g., pixel spacing, slice thickness) from DICOM files before requesting images.
  2. For custom workflows like loading enhanced JPEGs while using DICOM metadata:
     - Register a custom metadata provider to supply metadata for the images.
     - Ensure metadata caching occurs before images are requested to avoid race conditions.
  - Metadata provider example:
- For advanced calibration (e.g., pixel spacing corrections using reference images):
  - Use Cornerstone's calibration tools.
  - Example calibration usage:
- Documentation on calibration tools can be found in Cornerstone's utilities.
