## Questions and Summarized Answers  

### 📹 **I want to compare video segmentation implementation between 3D 2.0 and 3D 1.0**  
- **Context:** Before 2.0, segmentation relied on looping over actors and setting derived images. In 2.0, labelmap representations are used instead, and referenceImageIds are not passed when creating labelmaps.  
- There is a known bug where the label map is applied to all frames instead of per-frame segmentation.  
- The suggested approach is to submit a fix via GitHub for further discussion.

### 🖼️ **Very dark gray, black image in the beginning, but it is fine in MPR, frameview, and other layout. But in frame view, they are visible for the later viewports.**  
- Issue is reported here: [OHIF Viewers Issue #4778](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4778)  
- Suggested debugging approach: Identify the commit (either in CornerstoneJS or OHIF Viewer) that introduced the issue.

### 📏 **A new way of creating length annotation. Instead of drawing a line, can we ask the user to point two points and then we draw the line for them?**  
- This is not the default behavior of the length tool, but a custom tool can be created.  
- The **Angle Tool** logic can be used as a reference since it waits for multiple points before finalizing.  
- The key change is to modify `addNewAnnotation` and prevent additional points from being added after the second click.

### 🖍️ **We are looking for some help with debugging segmentation rendering errors; essentially we would run into errors when the segmentations are loaded and wanted to see if it's an OHIF issue or a data issue.**  
- [Related GitHub Issue #4766](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4766)  
- Suggested fix: Ensure **Google Healthcare API is using `v1beta1`**, as `v1` does not support bulk data retrieval.  
- Also referenced: [OHIF Viewers Issue #4118](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4118)

### 🍏 **With iOS 18.3 & 18.3.1, we have seen VolumeViewport3D rendering degraded & even volume rotation as well.**  
- The issue appears to be related to **WebGL and VTK.js compatibility** on iOS 18.3.  
- Increasing `sampleDistance` improves rotation smoothness but affects quality and memory usage.  
- Recommended action: **Report the issue to WebKit** instead of implementing a temporary workaround, as Apple may fix it in a future update.

### 🔥 **I have an .npy file for a heatmap of a CT scan and have been trying to show it as an overlay on the DICOM image in the viewer. Looking for guidance on how to do this.**  
- **Recommended approach:** Convert `.npy` to **parametric map (PMAP) DICOM** using the [highdicom library](https://highdicom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pm.html#parametric-maps).  
- PMAP support was introduced in **OHIF release 3.9** (October 2023).  
- If the overlay does not display correctly, update OHIF to the latest release branch (`release/3.9`).

### 🚫 **Is there a best way to exclude arrow measurement from customization label?**  
- The issue is that **customization labels are applied to all annotations, including arrows**, which should allow free-text input instead.  
- A workaround is to modify `getTextCallback` logic:  
  ```js
  if (excludedTools.includes(toolName)) return;
  ```  
- This is a **temporary hack**, and a more proper fix should be considered.

### 💾 **Does CornerstoneJS have a cache limit for uploading images to Orthanc?**  
- The issue is intermittent: uploaded studies appear in Orthanc but occasionally fail to open in OHIF.  
- **Potential causes:**  
  - A cache memory limit in CornerstoneJS  
  - A timing issue in study availability after upload  
- Suggested reference file for debugging:  
  - `extensions/cornerstone/src/utils/DicomFileUploader.ts`
