## Q & A

### The only way to call a callback on a HP is to use it through setHangingProtocol via commandsModule

Commands running do not belong in HPService. But Protocol has a callback which can store onProtocolExit and onProtocolEnter.

---

### What is the difference between the setProtocol and run

Run chooses the best protocol to apply. It is used on mode enter
setProtocol sets a protocol/stage explicitly (e.g., MPR)

### Follow up on the dynamic config PR

Final comments and we can merge
