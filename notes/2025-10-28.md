## Q & A

attendees: 9

### One-line summaries

- Issues rendering on mobile
- Issue rendering incorrect rgba response
- Incorrect rendering of DWI
- Unable to load after save in local mode

---

\*\* Mobile rendering

- Some mobile devices are missing 16 bit support, suggest trying CPU rendering for now
- upcoming fixes will improve CPU rendering for mobile devices as well as better UI

---

\*\* RGBA response instead of RGB

- It is incorrect to return an RGBA uncompressed data when RGB is expected. The right way to handle
  this is to fix it in Orthanc, but it would also be acceptable in the PR provided to check if the
  sample length was 3 to allow for a buffer 4/3 of the expected length

---

\*\* Incorrect rendering of DWI

- Looks like it is an issue with the 4d changes
- Going to submit a bug report for this with anonymized data

---

\*\* Unable to load after save

- Issue is using the wrong data loader, will create an issue
- Issue will probably not be looked at for some length of time
