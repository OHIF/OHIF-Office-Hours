# 📌 Questions and Summarized Answers  

### 🔄 **I've encountered stacks of images where the image direction changes between slices causing `_updateActorToDisplayImageId(image)` in `StackViewport.ts` to reset the WindowLevel due to direction mismatch. Since this seems intentional, what would be a good way to prevent it? Maybe a viewport configuration?**  
- The WindowLevel reset should only occur when specific attributes change:  
  - **Bits allocated**  
  - **Rescale slope**  
  - **Specified window level in the image**  
- Direction mismatch alone should not trigger a reset.  
- If this behavior is causing issues, a GitHub issue with anonymized data would be helpful.

### 🔍 **Why do we keep Pan and Zoom in the basic viewer and only Pan in the microscopy viewer? Particularly, Zoom in microscopy viewer works well with pinch-to-zoom at viewport (trackpad at laptop) or double-tap two fingers at mobile. Basic viewer does not support this yet.**  
- The **basic viewer and microscopy mode are separate implementations**, sharing only the rendering part.  
- The microscopy viewer is designed to work differently; it does not have explicit zoom buttons because zooming is expected via pinch gestures.  
- **Pinch-to-zoom exists in Cornerstone3D but may not be working due to recent changes.**  
  - There is an existing setting (`pinchToZoom: true`), but it needs debugging.  
  - Mouse wheel + Ctrl can also be used for zooming.  
- There are upcoming changes to allow custom default bindings in different modes.

### 🎥 **I'm having performance issues with 3D volume rotation with the latest iOS 18.2. I have tried calling `preMouseDownCallback()` on touch events and increasing the sample distance, and it shows some improvement. Are there any other settings to improve performance?**  
- **Increasing the sample distance helps**, but there is another approach using **VTK's desired update rate API**:  
  - The API dynamically adjusts sampling distance to maintain a target frame rate (e.g., 30 FPS).  
  - This method was tested but did not work out of the box.  
- Further investigation is needed to confirm if this approach can be successfully integrated.

### 📏 **Dotted lines appear during 3D volume rotation. Would reducing the default `clippingRange` impact coordinate computation or have any other implications?**  
- The `clippingRange` is crucial for coordinate calculations in volume rendering.  
- **Two concepts in VTK impact rendering:**  
  - **Clipping planes (affect data rendering)**
  - **Clipping range (affects camera projection matrix)**  
- Changing the `clippingRange` may impact coordinate accuracy.  
- A recommended approach is to check how VTK dynamically computes ranges and align with that.

### 📂 **Looking for a tool to generate DICOM files from DICOMWeb. Is there an existing solution?**  
- The `dcmjs-commands` repository is a **work in progress** to convert DICOMWeb data into DICOM files.  
- Current capability includes dumping metadata but does not fully write the DICOM file yet.  
- Completion is expected in the next **4-5 weeks**.

### 🖼 **What is the experience with 3D images from microscopes that produce large stacks (e.g., Light Sheet Microscope with images >1GB, 10GB)? How does OHIF scale?**  
- OHIF does not natively support `.raw` or `.tiff` formats but **DICOM conversion tools exist**:  
  - **Google's WSI-to-DICOM converter**  
  - **AGFA’s microscopy conversion software**  
- Performance depends on backend:  
  - **Static DICOMWeb is fine**
  - **DCM4CHE and Orthanc can be slow with large images**  
- JPEG-XL compression may improve efficiency.

### 🔐 **Does OHIF comply with data privacy? Can an adapted version be sold under the MIT license?**  
- **MIT license allows full commercialization**—you can sell an adapted version.  
- **FDA-approved versions of OHIF exist** (e.g., Radical Imaging's FlexView).

### ✏️ **The `hydrate` method of `LengthTool`, `CircleROI`, etc., associates annotations with slices in `VolumeViewport`. Why doesn’t it work in `StackViewport`?**  
- **StackViewport should support annotation association.**  
- Cornerstone3D includes an example of dynamically adding annotations that works with both stack and volume viewports.

### 📊 **Why does WADORS metadata provider default `ImagePositionPatient`, but WADOURI does not?**  
- **There is no specific reason** why WADOURI does not default this value.  
- It should be made consistent with WADORS for uniform behavior.

### 🔎 **Pinch-to-zoom is enabled in Cornerstone3D (`pinchToZoom: true`), but it does not work. Why?**  
- **The feature might be broken due to recent tool registration changes.**  
- Needs further debugging to confirm the issue.
