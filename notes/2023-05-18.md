## Q & A

### How to use Hanging Protocol to append a new viewport on the existing one

volume.

### How to request specific transfer syntax from servers

You can edit the `extensions/cornerstone/src/initWADOImageLoader.js` but there is an open PR
to make it configurable [here](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/3406)
