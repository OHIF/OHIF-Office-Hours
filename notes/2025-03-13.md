### Questions and Summarized Answers

---

üß© **I have some nifti files and I want to render these nifti files as segmentations. How can I create LabelMap segmentation from nifti volume using cornerstone3d 2.0?**  
- The best approach is to convert NIfTI to DICOM SEG using tools like [highdicom](https://highdicom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/seg.html) or [SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.org/).  
- OHIF internally works best with DICOM, so working directly with NIfTI requires hacking around segmentation services.  
- There's no known JavaScript/TypeScript version of highdicom; these tools are primarily meant for backend processing.  
- Suggested method:  
  1. Read the NIfTI file using Python (SimpleITK).  
  2. Convert it to DICOM SEG using highdicom.  
  3. Use it in OHIF without modifications.  
- A working example was shared: [Gist Link](https://gist.github.com/minimal-scouser/e55f7f58465c868c7bdd4e5a34de3945).

üîÑ **Scroll method does not update volume viewport unless render is called. This is not the case with stack. Is this intentional?**  
- No, this is likely a mistake.  
- A PR can be created to add a `render` call at the end of the scroll method for volumes.  
- This would be accepted and merged if implemented.  

---

üñä **After deleting an annotation, calling undo does not add it back. I would like to fix it.**  
- It was working before.  
- In Cornerstone, bidirectional modifications and undo operations work as expected.  
- Needs to be checked if the issue is specific to OHIF.  

---

üõ† **Is it possible to set up a debugger in Visual Studio Code to run while developing my custom OHIF mode and extension?**  
- Debugging inside VSCode is not commonly used by OHIF developers; most debugging happens in the browser.  
- Recommended method:  
  1. Open Chrome DevTools.  
  2. Use `Ctrl + P` to search for files.  
  3. Place breakpoints directly in the browser.  
  4. Access services via `window.services` in the DevTools console.  
  5. Use `debugger;` statements in the code.  
  6. Use React DevTools and Redux DevTools for state debugging.  
- Launch configurations and additional settings were not detailed, as browser debugging was recommended instead.

üì± **I'm getting a grey screen when I try to view the stack scroll or volume in my Android device even on the cornerstone examples. I have tried upgrading my cornerstone version to 2.19.12 but still the issue occurs.**  
- The issue occurs because `OES_texture_float_linear` is not supported on some Android devices.  
- Workaround:  
  1. Force interpolation type to `0`.  
  2. Check device capabilities using [debug.ohif.org](https://debug.ohif.org).  
  3. If `Float Linear` is `No`, force the use of `Half Float`.  
  4. Use [Piecewise Gaussian Widget](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/examples/PiecewiseGaussianWidget.html) in VTK.js for additional testing.  
- Related GitHub issue: [#1152](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1152).

üì∑ **Does OHIF/Cornerstone support parsing PR modality and applying them to the target series?**  
- No, this is not yet supported.  

---

üñç **Has there been any movement on supporting overlapping segmentations?**  
- Yes, a PR has been merged to support overlapping segmentations in Cornerstone.  
- Additional work is needed to refine segmentation editing behavior, such as:  
  - Overwrite vs. allow overlap options.  
  - Handling segment merging behavior based on clinical needs.  
- Example of overlap handling in Slicer was discussed.

üõë **We have a DICOM study for which SUV edition metadata throws an error: "Cannot decache an image with a shared cache key. You need to manually decache the volume first." If we add force to `cs3DCache.removeImageLoadObject(imageId, { force: true });` it works. Why does this happen for some studies and not others?**  
- This issue arises due to changes in Cornerstone3D 2.0 memory management.  
- In 2.0, images are stored individually and transferred directly to the GPU, meaning the cache holds only images, not volumes.  
- The error occurs because one of the images in a volume is being removed improperly.  
- Forcing decaching might not be safe and requires further investigation.
