🧩 **We are having some segmentation loading issues (specifically having to do with memory) – which requires throttling the segmentation viewer. Have you encountered this before?

Also: does Amazon Healthimaging work out of the box with OHIF? It looks like we are running into segmentation load problems directly from AHI.**

* **Segmentation memory issues**

  * High memory usage can occur when loading large or multiple segmentations
  * Throttling segmentation loading is a known mitigation strategy
* **Amazon Health Imaging (AHI) compatibility**

  * AHI does **not** work out of the box with OHIF for segmentation loading
  * OHIF expects **raw, uncompressed DICOM** for segmentations
  * AHI serves **compressed formats**, causing segmentation loading to stall or fail silently
* **Key technical limitation**

  * Current OHIF segmentation loaders assume full uncompressed DICOM retrieval
* **Reference viewer**
