## Questions and Summarized Answers  

### 📡 **Some events of stackviewport are fired on eventTarget and some on element. If this is expected then how can one know what is the source of the event while listening to them?**  
- Event sources depend on the logic behind their scope.  
- Segmentation data is on `eventTarget` since it can exist across multiple viewports.  
- Other events, such as viewport image changes, are tied to the `element`.  
- The logic follows:  
  - If an event is specific to a single viewport, it is fired on the `element`.  
  - If an event affects multiple viewports, it is fired on the `eventTarget`.  
- If an event placement seems incorrect, report it for review.

### 🖼️ **Was curious if there was an update on the window levels bug being reset on stack scroll images. If not, is there a workaround for the time being?**  
🔗 [Bug reference](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1770)  
- The issue is under review, but no fix has been pushed yet.  
- The root cause seems to be an issue with detecting slice consistency.  
  - The first slice might contain an outlier pixel affecting bit depth detection.  
  - The logic forces a 32-bit change instead of keeping 16-bit.  
- MR images have different window levels per slice, unlike CT, which might contribute to the issue.  
- Possible workaround:  
  - Modify `updateActiveDisplayImageId` logic to bypass unnecessary bit depth changes.  
  - Remove the old code that forces a reset when the data type changes.  
  - Ensure window levels follow slice metadata where applicable.

### 🎨 **I am trying to render a CT scan using VTK.js but I am confused how to get the colors of individual pixels of each scan. Is this where modalityLUT comes into play?**  
- If using **only VTK.js**, you need to handle color transformations manually.  
- DICOM images store pixel values, which require multiple transformations:  
  - **Modality LUT** (Maps raw pixel values to Hounsfield Units or similar).  
  - **VOI LUT (Window Leveling)** (Adjusts brightness/contrast for display).  
  - **Presentation LUT** (Final adjustments like inversion).  
- To extract pixel colors, you need to apply these transformations.  
- Alternative: Use **Cornerstone.js**, which already manages LUT transformations.

### 🔄 **We noticed a change in the “jump to slice” behavior for annotation/measurements in 3.9 and beyond that we would like to understand better as it does not look like a bug but more like intended behavior.**  
- The behavior changed due to updates in how view references are handled between stacks and volumes.  
- Previously, the viewport would switch back to the first image series.  
- Now, the logic keeps the second image series loaded if it has the same **Frame of Reference UID**.  
- This is likely not a bug but a consequence of changes in reference handling.  
- A GitHub issue should be created if a different behavior is preferred.

### ☁️ **numInstances is 0 in study metadata coming from GCP. Should we do any other actions to support that DICOM tag (0020,1208)?**  
- This is a known issue with **GCP and Azure**; they return empty values for `numInstances`.  
- The correct approach is to query at the **series and instance levels** instead of relying on study metadata.  
- A workaround is to avoid displaying `0` when the value is missing.  
- Contacting GCP for clarification is recommended.  

---

### 📉 **Bunch of `ANNOTATION_REMOVED` event is triggered when switching to MPR. Why is this happening?**  
- When switching to MPR, the viewport is **disabled and re-enabled**, triggering removal events.  
- `ANNOTATION_REMOVED` fires when the viewport updates, **not when annotations are deleted**.  
- This is expected behavior, as MPR requires a fresh viewport setup.  

---

### 🔑 **Is there a version of OHIF which ships with a login?**  
- OHIF does **not** include authentication by default.  
- Authentication depends on the backend (Google Healthcare API, Azure, Keycloak, etc.).  
- Documentation on securing OHIF is available: [OHIF Authentication Docs](https://docs.ohif.org/deployment/authentication.html).  
- Shipping OHIF with built-in authentication is impractical since each deployment uses different authentication methods.

### 🔧 **Discuss on PRs related to annotation tracking simplification**  
🔗 [Issue #4622](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/4622#issuecomment-2619120749)  
🔗 [PR #4634](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/4634#pullrequestreview-2578767958)  
- The PR proposes a middle-ground tracking mode, avoiding complex tracking workflows.  
- The goal is to allow tracking without excessive manual intervention.  
- Discussion on whether a **dirty flag** in Cornerstone is needed for this feature.  
- **Decision:**  
  - Use measurement service tracking instead of modifying Cornerstone.  
  - Check the `annotation modified` event with change types for better control.

### 🚀 **Deployed OHIF to AWS S3, converted DICOM studies using static-wado-creator, but browsing CloudFront results in a 403 Forbidden error.**  
🔗 [Static DICOMWeb Deployment Guide](https://github.com/RadicalImaging/Static-DICOMWeb/blob/feat/fast-s3-upload/packages/s3-deploy/README.md)  
- Likely causes:  
  - CloudFront permissions do not allow access to S3.  
  - Origin access settings might be incorrect.  
  - The DICOMWeb folder structure might not match expected paths.  
- Solutions:  
  - Ensure CloudFront has access to the S3 bucket using **Origin Access Control**.  
  - Verify the `/dicomweb/studies` endpoint returns valid JSON.  
  - Use the `deploy-dicomweb-studies` command to upload studies properly.

### 📱 **DX modality DICOM with missing rescale intercept/slope causing errors on mobile. How to handle this?**  
- The **DICOM spec requires** these tags but allows them to be absent in certain cases.  
- If missing, default to:  
  - **Intercept: 0**  
  - **Slope: 1**  
- This should prevent rendering issues.  
- **OHIF Mobile Support:**  
  - **Currently being reworked** with a new component library.  
  - Expected improvements soon.

### ✏️ **When adding line and angle measurements with customization service, I’m able to add measurements for two series. When switching to a third series, measurements are not tracking.**  
🔗 [Bug fix PR #4739](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/4739)  
- The issue is related to how measurement tracking updates across series.  
- A fix is in progress—follow the PR for updates.
