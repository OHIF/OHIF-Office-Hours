# 📌 Questions and Summarized Answers  

### 🎥 **I want to discuss my findings on the video segmentations. One more question below.**  
- Discussion focused on the image change event listener and viewport behavior for video segmentation.  
- The failure occurs because video viewports are not VTK.js driven, causing the remove actors call to fail.  
- Suggested approach:  
  - Follow the same logic as the image change listener in stack viewports.  
  - Debug using `git bisect` to find where the issue started.  
  - Reverting to the old implementation seems to work.

### 🎞️ **I'm working on a web-based DICOM uploader where I need to convert a DICOM file into a video (MP4, WebM, etc.) directly on the client-side using cornerstone.js before uploading it to DCM4CHEE. The goal is to allow users to preview the DICOM as a video before committing to the upload. What are the best approaches or libraries for doing this efficiently in the browser? Or should I just use a minimal viewer?**  
- Instead of converting DICOM to video, using a **cine tool** for previewing is a better approach.  
- Converting to video in-browser is inefficient and unnecessary.  
- Suggested solution:  
  - Use the **OHIF Cine Tool** to enable video-like playback of multi-frame DICOM images.  
  - Reference: [OHIF Cine Tool Example](https://www.cornerstonejs.org/live-examples/cinetool)

### 🏥 **We are using the Orthanc plugin Docker image version 1.12.6 for integrating OHIF. We encountered an issue where, if the Patient ID is set to NA, navigating to the URL displays not only the selected study but also studies of other patients in the left panel. Additionally, the Patient Name does not update correctly.**  
- **Main Issue**: Having `NA` as a Patient ID is **illegal DICOM** behavior.  
- **Temporary Fix**: Disable prior study search by setting `studyBrowser.studyMode.primary = false` in the configuration.  
- **Long-term Fix**: Implement a change so that prior searches are not performed when `PatientID` is undefined.  
- **Further Issue**: If multiple patients have the same Patient ID, their names will not update correctly.  
  - A synthetic Patient ID based on hash (Name, Sex, DOB, StudyUID) could resolve this.

### 🔄 **Regarding the bug https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/issues/1861, when a stack of images is flipped vertically and horizontally and scrolled, the horizontal flip appears to be lost. Is there a workaround? And why is rotation changed when scrolling through flipped slices?**  
- **Acknowledged as a known bug. No workaround yet.**  
- **The relationship between flipping and rotation:**  
  - Flipping is different from rotation; it requires repositioning the camera, not just rotating the image.  
- **Action Item**: A fix is planned for a future update.

### 💻 **We are attempting to build the OHIF plugin on aarch64(ARM64) architecture using Orthanc 1.12.6, but accessing OHIF at `/ohif/` gives "Accessing nonexistent item, Orthanc status 7".**  
- **Possible Issue**: OHIF **did not support ARM64 in v3.9**, but ARM64 support was recently added in **OHIF 3.10 beta**.  
- **Suggested Solution**:  
  - Try using the **OHIF 3.10 beta** Docker image, which includes ARM64 support.  
  - Ask in the **Orthanc Forum** about loading beta versions into Orthanc: [Orthanc Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/orthanc-users)

### 👀 **I noticed in 3.9 that segmentations cannot be hidden in 3D viewports. Is there a plan to implement that functionality?**  
- Related PR: [cornerstone3D #1846](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/1846/files)

### ⚙️ **I need help creating a new mode as described in the Getting Started videos. I get an error message and the training mode will not launch. This used to work. Can someone help with my configuration?**  
- **Root Cause**: A bug in **mode creation** was fixed in a recent OHIF PR.  
- **Solution**: Update OHIF to the latest version or manually apply the fix from [PR #7d](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/pull/7d).  
- **Issue with Forum Posts**: The OHIF forum recently migrated due to spam issues, causing delays in approvals.

### 🖥️ **I've been working on stack viewports and now upgrading to volumes with MPR view. How viable is volume rendering on older PCs without a dedicated GPU?**  
- **OHIF requires a GPU** for volume rendering. Integrated GPUs can work, but performance depends on dataset size.  
- **Alternatives:**  
  - Subsampled volumes for MPR using smaller datasets.  
  - A CPU-based rendering pipeline **does not currently exist** but could be developed with funding.

### 🔄 **I want to discuss this PR that got reverted.**  
- The PR attempted to introduce a separate opacity control for active segmentations.  
- **Solution**: Instead of a new API, use **per-segment control** via `segmentationConfig.setStyle()`.
