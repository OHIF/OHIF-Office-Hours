# OHIF Office Hours Notes 204-01-25


## Q & A

Attendees: 13



## Q: UI bug found, segmentation toolbox buttons get disabled when it’s collapsed and expanded again. I think button state should be persisted if we add one or more segmentations.

A: Thanks ,can you report it in the Github.

### Q: Measurement tracking in multiple MPR viewports.
I can see how UIDs are retrieved from the DicomeMetadataStore using the image ID.
With the changes now merged in cornerstone3D regarding the targetID and volumeID, how can I modify the code to retrieve the UIDs using a volumeID instead.
PR in question : https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/pull/1009

A: Eventually OHIF should implement the 3D SR reports. The tricky bit is to determine what it applies to, for ROI it applies to volumes, so it is volumetric not image based.

### Q: When adjusting slab thickness, what are the functions that decide how to resample the input slices?

A: vtkVolumeFS in vtk applyBlend - you want to apply a mean.  
THere isn’t any resampling done - the resampling is done at display time directly for displaying the data.  Sampling can be different depending on where in the voxel you end up displaying.  Also take a look at the raycasting to figure out which voxels end up being displayed

### Q: Using ReferenceCursors, If there are two viewports open and I scroll to the middle of the first viewport, the tool doesn't scroll in the correspondingviewport. This is what happens when I use StackCrosshairs and click on a point. Is this at all supported natively or would I have to implement it manually.

A: Check to see that they are part of the same tool group.  You may also need to set positionSync: true.  See the CS3d reference cursor example, which seems to do what you want.

### Q: https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/3906

A: Please provide reproduction steps in a standard browser if you can.  We were not able to reproduce this on any android devices we had available.  Otherwise try looking at the offscreen/onscreen canvas sizes and attributes.

### Q:  https://community.ohif.org/t/presentation-state-error-for-mr-images/1239

A: Can seem to view them when dragging into OHIF.
Some of the objects are raw data storage, and those are not viewable as images.  The SOP class should be excluded and marked as another type for display, probably usign the DICOM tag browser as there isn’t other native support for viewing the data.

--- 

### Q: How can I disable resampling in the main volume viewport (just like the stack viewport, where a stack of images was loaded)? If I just keep the slab thickness the same as the slice thickness, and the viewPlaneNormal the same as that of imageOrientationPatient, that may work. Do we have a better way to do so?

A: There is a setting to turn interpolation off - that is for rendering.

viewport.setProperties({interpolationType: 0})
If you are displaying even a little oblique, you can’t avoid resampling because no single image is exactly what you are looking at.


--- 

### Q:  I integrate PlanarFreehandROI and i can draw, save to dcm4chee but displaying it after this save is not working?

A: Please create an issue that this is a bug in the CS3D data restore.

--- 

### Q: A user wants to be able to set slab thickness for all viewports.  Do you recommend a menu pulldown with that, or is it better to use a hanging protocol?

A: Probably just depends on what users want, either will work - or a sync for slab thickness.

---

### Q: A user wants to view average instead of mip - is there an example that shows average view instead (in CS3D)?

A: Crosshairs example has a pulldown allowing it to be selected

### Q: I am using OHIF’s ecg-extension to render ecg waveforms. However,  while retrieving Channel Data using BulkDataURI I do not get the complete response.

A: Either it is being served correctly or not converted correctly 

Use https://github.com/RadicalImaging/Static-DICOMWeb/tree/master/packages/static-wado-creator

To convert p10 to static wado dicomweb format and then use 

https://github.com/RadicalImaging/Static-DICOMWeb/tree/master/packages/static-wado-webserver 

To serve the files
