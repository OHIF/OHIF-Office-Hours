# OHIF Office Hours Notes 2024-08-22

## Q & A

Attendees: Not specified

Discussed:

üõ†Ô∏è **I am trying to add my own custom tool to OHIF. How can I customize the OHIF viewer by adding my own tool?? Where can I find documentation on this?**

A: Adding a custom tool to OHIF involves several steps:

1. Tool Definition: Define your tool in a file similar to the ones in the segmentation mode (e.g., buttons.ts).

2. UI Placement: Use the toolbar service to add your tool to the desired location. You can create sections like primary or toolbox.

3. Command Registration: Register a command in the commands module that will be executed when the tool is clicked.

4. Tool Implementation: Implement the logic for your tool in the command.

5. Evaluation: Set up an evaluator to determine the tool's state (active, disabled, etc.).

Key points:
- Use the toolbar service to add button definitions
- Create sections for tool placement (e.g., primary, toolbox)
- Register commands for tool actions
- Use evaluators to manage tool states

For detailed documentation, refer to the toolbar service and toolbar module in the OHIF docs. The migration guide for the toolbar may also be helpful.

üñ•Ô∏è **Can we use CPU rendering for thumbnail images and GPU rendering for viewport images? loadImageToCanvas utility function has useCPURendering option, but this causes an error for some images. I think it's because of this line - https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D/blob/e14af95b33e92828f3e0c8c21f0dc9319647abda/packages/core/src/utilities/loadImageToCanvas.ts#L182. Image requests are cached, so when rendering on viewports using GPU, useRGBA will be true since I am using useCPURendering: true. Therefore, a range error like "model.size is not multiple of numberOfComponents" is happening. Any method to separate the thumbnail request and viewport image request?**

A: To address the issue of using CPU rendering for thumbnails and GPU rendering for viewports:

1. The correct long-term solution is to rework the study browser component to make thumbnail rendering asynchronous and use React 18's Suspense feature.

2. For a more immediate solution, you can add a "prevent cache" option to the loadImageToCanvas function:

   - Modify the loadImageToCanvas function to accept a preventCache option
   - When preventCache is true, use loadImage instead of loadAndCacheImage
   - This will prevent caching for thumbnail images, avoiding conflicts with viewport rendering

3. Implement this change and create a pull request for the OHIF team to review and integrate.

This approach should solve the RGBA inconsistencies you're experiencing between thumbnail and viewport rendering.

üñºÔ∏è **Following up on last week's disappearing view overlays - this only occurs with multiframe images. I can hack a fix in ohif/extensions/cornerstone/src/Viewport/Overlays/CustomizableViewportOverlay.tsx**

A: The issue with disappearing viewport overlays for multiframe images seems to be related to how the image index is handled. The proposed hack involves:

1. Adding a new variable: var index = imageIndex;
2. Checking if instances[imageIndex] is undefined
3. If undefined, setting index to 0 (for multiframe images)
4. Using this index to get the correct instance

While this hack works, it suggests there might be an underlying issue with how multiframe images are handled in custom modes compared to the Basic Viewer mode.

To properly address this:

1. Try to reproduce the issue using the multi-frame MR study in the OHIF viewer dev environment
2. Document the steps to reproduce and the configuration used
3. Create a GitHub issue with this information, including the proposed hack
4. The OHIF team can then investigate why this is necessary for custom modes but not for the Basic Viewer mode

This approach will help identify if there's a broader issue that needs to be addressed in the core OHIF code.

üöÄ **What is ETA for cornerstone 2.0? Beta branch can we take as it is or do we need any compatible OHIF branch as well?**

A: Cornerstone 2.0 is nearing completion with some significant changes:

1. Timeline: About a week of work remaining to finalize and test.

2. Major Changes:
   - Segmentation now tied to viewports instead of tool groups for more flexibility
   - Memory optimization: Removal of volume cache, everything now in image cache
   - 3D textures created only on GPU side, reducing CPU memory usage
   - Native format storage for image data, conversion done during GPU upload
   - Removal of shared array buffer dependency

3. Compatibility: These changes will require updates to OHIF to be fully compatible. The OHIF team is working on a migration guide.

4. Current Status: You can use the beta branch, but be aware that there might be some breaking changes, especially related to segmentation handling and memory management.

5. Testing: Before final release, the team plans to conduct widespread testing across different systems.

For the most up-to-date information, monitor the Cornerstone 3D GitHub repository and look out for the official release announcement.

üîç **How I can select which series is loaded and show when I open study with list of them? For example, in the link below if I want to load a series with 120 images, how should I modify the url or functionality? Also when we show 1 series in basic mode and 4 series in segmentation mode?**

A: To control which series are loaded and displayed in OHIF:

1. URL Parameters:
   - Use StudyInstanceUID to specify the study
   - Use SeriesInstanceUID to specify a particular series
   - Example: https://viewer-dev.ohif.org/viewer?StudyInstanceUIDs=studyID&SeriesInstanceUIDs=seriesID

2. Initial Series:
   - Use initialSeriesInstanceUID in the URL to specify which series should be loaded first
   - This will load the specified series while still allowing access to others

3. Mode-specific Layouts:
   - Different modes (e.g., basic, segmentation) can have different hanging protocols
   - These are defined in the mode configuration files
   - For example, segmentation mode might be set up to show 4 viewports by default

4. Custom Implementation:
   - You can modify the hanging protocols or create custom ones to control how series are displayed in different modes

5. Search Option:
   - It's possible to implement a search or filter functionality in the study list to allow users to select specific series

For more details, refer to the OHIF documentation on URL configuration: https://docs.ohif.org/configuration/url#initialseriesinstanceuid

üìä **We have an Echocardiogram report available. We are trying to find DICOM code mapping for each label. Somewhere we failed to map all the fields. Is there was any consortium for provide these mapping**

A: Regarding DICOM code mapping for Echocardiogram reports:

1. OHIF has an ECG viewer extension that might be helpful. You can find it in the extension mode gallery on the OHIF website.

2. For specific DICOM code mappings, the OHIF team member (Bill) who developed the ECG extension would be the best person to ask. He's currently on vacation but should be available next week.

3. There isn't a specific consortium mentioned for providing these mappings, but there might be industry standards or guidelines that Bill could point you towards.

4. If you need immediate assistance, you might want to consult DICOM standards documentation or reach out to medical imaging informatics communities for guidance on echocardiogram report mappings.

It's recommended to join next week's office hours to discuss this with Bill, who has more expertise in this specific area.

üîß **While marking the measurements on the OHIF viewer, it throws an error related to 'useMachine'hook rendering. so we cannot save the study measurements. please guide me about this**

A: The error related to the 'useMachine' hook could be due to using an outdated version of OHIF. Here are the steps to resolve this:

1. Version Check: You mentioned using OHIF version 3.7.0, which is about a year old (released in October 2023).

2. Update Recommendation: 
   - Update to at least version 3.8.0, or preferably the latest stable version.
   - Alternatively, you can use the latest master branch for the most up-to-date fixes.

3. Troubleshooting:
   - If updating isn't immediately possible, you can review the PRs and release notes between 3.7.0 and the current version to identify and patch the specific issue.

4. Testing:
   - After updating, test the measurement saving functionality again.
   - In the latest versions, measurements should save and persist even after refreshing the page.

5. Further Assistance:
   - If the issue persists after updating, provide more details about the specific error message and the steps to reproduce it.

Updating to a more recent version of OHIF should resolve this issue, as many bugs and improvements have been implemented since version 3.7.0.
